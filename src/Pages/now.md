### Things I'm Into At the Moment 

I track pretty much everything that I'm reading/watching/listening to with the help of several websites. 
- My [Storygraph profile](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/srgower) for books I'm currently reading as well as reviews and ratings for previous reads
- My [Letterboxd profile](https://letterboxd.com/stephen_g/) for movies I've watched & rated/reviewed
- My [Last.FM profile](https://www.last.fm/user/sgower) for what I've listened to recently
  - Bonus: some [fun reports](https://www.last.fm/user/sgower/listening-report) Last.FM generates based on my listening activity

I switch around TV shows a lot more often than movies; but here's what I have in rotation at the moment: 
* Flight of the Conchords *(Re-watch)*
* X-Men (1992-1997)
