![Jays From Home Logo](/images/podcast-art/jfh.png#podcast-logo "Jays From Home") [Jays From Home](https://linktr.ee/JaysFromHome): A Toronto Blue Jays podcast co-hosted by brothers Steve and Matt Gower. Every Monday they recap the past week of #BlueJays baseball. Occasionally the podcast features various guests from writers, to podcasters, and even former Jays manager John Gibbons!

<img class="podcast-logo" src="/images/podcast-art/slow-reader.png" alt="The Slow Reader Logo" /> [The Slow Reader](https://slowreader.art.blog): The Slow Reader is a book review podcast that covers books I'm reading at a pace that I'm comfortable with - which is a little bit slow.  Listen in if you're looking for someone who reads at a pace closer to yours! 

<img class="podcast-logo" src="/images/podcast-art/alt-airwaves.png" alt="Alternative Airwaves Logo" /> [Alternative Airwaves](https://www.alternativeairwaves.com): There are a lot of really great artists that go unnoticed, and their music is freely and legally available online. Alternative Airwaves discovers those artists.

<img class="podcast-logo" src="/images/podcast-art/Futurama.png" alt="Futurama Pedia Logo" /> [Futurama Pedia](http://futuramapedia.blogspot.com/): An unofficial Futurama podcast! Mike & Steve talk Futurama and everything in between.[^1]
