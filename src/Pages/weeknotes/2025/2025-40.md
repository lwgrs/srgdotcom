### Things this week 
This week saw the annual observance of the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. For many people this was a statutory holiday, but it's one of those weird ones where not everyone gets it - so there wasn't much closed up for the day. I'm not sure how many people actually "observed" the day or recognized it's significance, but it was nonetheless a welcome day off. It certainly made for an odd week in terms of working days. 

Overall the week was a mixed bag with a lot of things happening in all my usual categories. Read on...
### Health Notes
I noticed what appears to be a bone spur on my right foot. I don't know why I hadn't seen it before, but I guess it's one of those things that build up gradually so that might explain it. It would also explain why I have such a hard time with shoes on my right foot, but they are fine on my left. I made an appointment to see my doctor about it, I'll see him in 2 weeks. 
### Tech & Blog Stuff 
I experienced some technical difficulty with my [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) setup this past week, and ended up having to reset everything from scratch. Although - I may not have. After setting everything up fresh, my laptop kept showing that it was out of sync even though all the files were downloaded. I troubleshooter a bunch of things until I realized I could click on file details to see what's wrong. 

In a moment deserving the Picard forehead meme, the problem turned out to be Windows not accepting file names with a trailing space. I had a folder called `/Recipes /` that was causing an issue. I went to my Android phone and corrected the folder and that fixed everything. It's the little things. 
### Media 
Most of the week was spent listening to the "Rising Strong" (Brené Brown) audiobook I borrowed from the library. I'm enjoying this one, though Libby has some trouble with the chapters. I may need to switch to the Spotify version but I'm nearly 70% through the book, I will probably just finish it via Libby. 

On the video game front, I borrowed *Star Wars Outlaws* from the library. I was promised an open world *Star Wars* game so was a little dismayed at how guided the opening story bits were; then I realized that this was a tutorial mission, and some cursory research told me that the open world parts were yet to come. I found the game on sale so I bit the bullet and bought my own copy. I feel like this is a game I'm going to come back to on an on-and-off basis for a long time that the library just won't handle for me.

For sports - it's an exciting time. The Blue Jays started their ALDS series vs the Yankees on Saturday and outscored them 23-8, taking a 2-0 lead. This is fun.
