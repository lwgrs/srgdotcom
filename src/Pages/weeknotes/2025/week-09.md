### Things this week 

- Ontario voted Thursday evening; while I voted for my preferred candidate, it didn't make a difference as the result was decided within 15 minutes of the polls closing. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss (literally, we have the same Premier as before the election). 

### Health Notes

- My cold was at its worst on Tuesday, and I had some rough nights sleeping. Things got better on Thursday when I was a lot more alert. Friday was more-or-less the same. 
- It's so easy to fall away from daily calorie logging. I got as far as Wednesday Breakfast + Lunch but stopped at dinner; we ordered out for dinner and I didn't feel like looking up calorie information from the restaurant. Then I didn't do anything all day Thursday because I was having a tough / stressful day. I was about to skip Friday too but then started typing this line. 

### Media 

- I've been playing a lot of NHL 25 (PS5) in short bursts. There is a big difficulty learning curve compared to what I'm used to. I think I'm getting better but there are several things I haven't gotten down yet (most especially the passing...I don't know how many times I've iced the puck on a faceoff at centre ice or passed the puck out of the offensive zone to my end of the ice on a power play...)
  - One great thing I never took advantage of before is that you can borrow games from the library. This is going to be my best bet at trying different games because they're so expensive. Although I am now wondering if doing something like pre-installing *MLB The Show 24* before buying my own copy would work, since the disc essentially acts as a license key...does that mean I need to re-install it with a different disc?
- The first trailer for Season 2 of *Andor* dropped, but I haven't watched it - and I don't plan to. I'm watching the show anyway so I'm already excited about it. I will be re-watching season 1 ahead of the April 22 release date - and forcing my wife to watch with me. 
- The Oscars sucked me again this year. Even though I'm not as familiar with the films nominated this year, not even on a name recognition basis, I love the show. I'm typing this after the Best Director award, so there's still a bit to go. As always, I have some more movies to watch this coming year. 

### Tech & Blog Stuff 

- Much hoopla has been made (probably deserved) of recent changes made by Mozilla regarding personal data and their privacy policy. I'm waiting until the noise dies down before really looking into it. What happens a lot is people misinterpret these changes to mean something that it doesn't, but the company making them also doesn't do themselves any favours by not explaining them properly.  Also, I don't plan on switching away from Firefox anytime soon - it works for me.
