### Things this week 

- I started work on the Harry Potter "Potions Class" LEGO set ([number 76431](https://www.lego.com/en-ca/product/hogwarts-castle-potions-class-76431)). I'm timing my sessions this time - 1st session was about 26 minutes.
	- Second session, to complete: 45 minutes. Around an hour and ten minutes total.
- I had to add some new filters to Mastodon. For Canadian politics (an election was called for April 28th), `CPC`. For general politics and stuff I don't care about, `capitalism` and `GDP`. I'm sure there will be many more as posts crop up. 
- Started a new "memories" file. Anytime something triggers a memory, write down that memory. And the trigger, when we possible.
- My wife's birthday was Sunday!! We didn't do anything special - napped, went for dinner. It was a crappy day weather-wise, that was disappointing. 
	- Luckily we did not get as severe a storm as was forecast. 
### Health Notes

- I've had lower back pain (isolated to the left side) for a few weeks now; in general it's fine, but the chairs at work seem to aggravate it. We have standing desks so I'm making use of those on and off. 
- Wednesday March 26th was Purple Day, or Epilepsy Awareness Day. Believe it or not I actually forgot about it until late in the day. 

### Media 

- I forgot another thing last week. I found the complete box set of *ReBoot* at Wal-Mart while I was looking around for a birthday card for my wife. I jumped in last Sunday night to the start of the Web episodes of season two (starts with "Painted Windows", continues in "Nullzilla"). It looks really good on the PS5, but the audio is a little choppy. Good enough for me! 
- My wife and I saw a play Wednesday night: **[Secret to Good Tea](https://nac-cna.ca/en/event/36003)** by Rosana Deerchild. It's part of the [NAC's](https://nac-cna.ca) Indigenous Theatre. It was at times funny but mostly serious. Lots of emotion on stage. 
- The **[It's Storytime with Wil Wheaton](https://wilwheaton.net/podcast/)** podcast premiered Wednesday with the story "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Love, Death" and it's a neat little time travel love story. 
- I'm giving up on *The Great Train Robbery* (Crichton). I was enjoying it at first, but I've lost interest. Life's too short to force yourself to read a book you're not into.

### Tech & Blog Stuff 


- Successfully setup Miniflux RSS reader on my server. Going to try it out for a bit as an alternative to Feedly.
- File Browser is up and running now, too! Huge thanks to <a href="https://squ.eeeee.lol" class="nametag">Sylvia</a> for the help and doing the major legwork.
	- I broke the server a couple times on Tuesday; nothing major but I learned a thing or two about changing read/write permissions with help from ChatGPT 
- I think my next tech tinkering project will be to figure out how to upgrade my macbook's OS; officially it's no longer supported but I remember reading about OpenCore Legacy to bring it up to date. I looked into it, seems like it needs a good chunk of time to complete. Not sure when I'll get to this one.
