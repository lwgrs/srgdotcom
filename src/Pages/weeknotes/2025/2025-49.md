### Things this week 
I've been thinking a lot about my organization methods this week. <a href="https://html-chunder.neocities.org" class="nametag">zkbro</a> started a series outlining his approach to GTD. In the first post - "capturing" - he mentions the PARA method; I've seen this making the rounds online many different times so I did a little bit of research into it and I'm trying to implement it in Obsidian. 

On top of that, in thinking about my ongoing search for an A5 monthly calendar (seriously...these don't exist. The only A5 sized notebooks are monthly/weekly planners) I'm tinkering with the idea of trying a pre-printed planner for 2026. Either Moleskine or Leuchtturm; I like the bullet journal method but I think I could combine a pre-printed planner with a notebook for short notes and my journal for longform writing. Time for a trip to Staples - my wife will be happy.
### Health Notes
My follow-up appointment with my doctor was this past Thursday; it was to discuss the results of the x-ray of my foot. Unfortunately nothing could be determined from the x-ray so I'll have to schedule another follow-up after I get my ultrasound done in January (apparently ultrasounds are extremely backed up in this city). For now my foot hasn't gotten worse and it's more annoying and a curiosity than a "problem", so I'm not concerned. I just want to know what it is and if there's anything I can do so my shoes fit properly again. 

The only other note I can think of is that we slept through our alarm on Wednesday; this is rare, because the alarm is LOUD (we use the buzzer, not the radio). I guess it turns off after a while! I still got to work "on time", but that means we also haven't been getting enough sleep lately. It happens from time to time.
### Media 
This week I learned that Rich Terfy (aka Buck 65) was once scouted by the **New York Yankees** before a knee injury ended his baseball career at 16. I was listening to the CBC Radio 3 podcast for December 2, 2005 (courtesy [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/cbcradio3podcast?sort=-date&and%5B%5D=creator%3A%22grant+lawrence%22&and%5B%5D=collection%3A%22cbcradio3podcast%22)). That's what started a pretty varied week as far as media goes - for games, I had a complaint about *NHL 26* - that the two PWHL expansion teams, Vancouver and Seattle, did not have their logos or uniforms in the game. I should have held back my vocal complaint because it was resolved with an update within a day. Woops! 

Thursday night I watched a season 3 episode of *Star Trek Enterprise*, "Twilight". I listened to an episode commentary by [Transporter Room 3](https://www.patreon.com/TransporterRoom3) and this was an episode I hadn't seen; it can be boiled down to "Star Trek does *50 First Dates*", but don't sleep on it - so many things happen in this episode and the VFX was really cool and well-done. I recommend it. 

Lastly I found out about a video game tracking website, [Backloggd](https://backloggd.com), via <a href="https://joelchrono.xyz" class="nametag">Joel</a>. It reminds me a lot of [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com) and I think that's the intent. I have been tracking my video games manually in Obsidian, and while that is kind of a fun project, this is a service that does what I'm doing better and more efficiently. I don't mind signing up for services if they do something really well, so take a gander [at my profile](https://backloggd.com/u/srg84/) - which is woefully incomplete.
