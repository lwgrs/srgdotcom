### Things this week 
The week started with a heat warning and finished with an air quality warning due to forest fires out west. We still have an air quality warning and this morning (and this afternoon actually) it still smells heavily of smoke. Not good. We also haven't had rain in weeks; the grass is brown and brittle. As much as I want to play softball, I'm hoping we do get some rain. Thankfully the air quality is supposed to improve by tomorrow (Tuesday). 

I finished up my CBC Radio 3 cassette mixtape (wrote out the track info on the label) and plan to post something about it soon; I want to get the audio uploaded and available, as well as take pictures of the finished cassette. Once I do that I'll write something about it. 

Two of my employees had their last day with the company on Friday. It's not going to hit until Tuesday when they're not there at their usual desk. 
### Health Notes
- Very tired this week; all our softball games finished late (and we played 5 - two double-headers).
### Tech Stuff 
- I cleaned underneath the dial of my smartwatch this week; it was *very* dirty and gunky, and I've been meaning to for a while. Very easy to pop the dial off and clean underneath but as it turns out I'm missing a pair of springs & ball bearings. Turns out the parts from a Gear S3 will work, and my friend has my old dead Gear S3...so there's that. Hoping to fully refresh this watch (something I'm going to write about soon, too).
### Media 
- [enjoying Lee Child's "Die Trying"](https://ottawa.place/@srgower/114942073111086794) - quick, pulpy read
- ordered from Bandcamp Friday. Mistakenly ordered digital only copy of Sloan's album. Not going to order the CD on top of it (no refund options it seems)
	- refunds are done directly through the band/record label. I contacted them and got a response right away. Will be getting a refund so I ordered the CD
- _The Naked Gun_ (2025) was really good
