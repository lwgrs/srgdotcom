### Things this week 
It's best to describe this week as "up and down". There were highs (see what I wrote about the Senators below) and there were lows (again - Senators, but also my food logging). I didn't jot down many notes throughout the week outside of my "categories", I suppose that means overall the week could be considered "neutral" at best. 

The wildest thing I experienced was a microburst. Tuesday night I was at dinner with my fellow managers. It was a rainy day overall, and it was fairly windy. As we were sitting I could see the wind really picking up out of the corner of my eye, and I could tell it was building up. But then it *exploded* into a massive burst of wind, blowing everything around. The door near the table must have been open a crack, because the wind forced it open and the curtains were being sucked out. 

It was so quick, over as quick as it started. I was almost sure we were experiencing a tornado, but it was too short for that. I've never seen a microburst, that was a first. 
### Health Notes
Nothing to report, good or bad; I had what was supposed to be a temporary pause in food logging on Wednesday, but turned into a longer pause including today (Sunday). I've had a tough time getting back into it, telling myself, "restart today". But it hasn't set in. I'll try to get back on top of it Monday. Additionally I'm going to try to do better at meeting my targets and not exceeding them. 

And I guess this best belongs in the "health" section: I had some bad timing during softball practice Sunday and while trying to catch a fly ball, my thumb got hit hard. It hurt a LOT and is currently still tender. The bruising is super evident. I iced it as often as possible and as of 10:35pm Sunday night it actually isn't as bad as it was earlier in the day. 

### Tech & Blog Stuff 
Some fun things happening this week but I'll start off with an oddity: my **iPod Touch** *(7th generation)* received a software update. It's now running iOS **15.8.4**. I'm reasonably sure that this was a security update, but that in itself surprises me because I thought it was an abandoned device. 

An Obsidian plugin I found: [Write Good](obsidian://show-plugin?id=write-good) I wrote a blog post using the plugin and I liked the way it identified various ways I could strengthen my writing. The downside: I don't like how it picks up my bullet-point notes. I have to turn it on/off as needed. 

Blog stuff: I turned off [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app) for my Bear Blog posts, and left it on for this site and my photo blog. I just feel spammy sending my links everywhere, all the time, and I don't want to share all of my posts. I'll share the posts I want to manually; there is a way around this though. I could link my RSS feed for a specific tag (let's say, `share`) and EchoFeed will just share those posts. We'll see. 

Other fun stuff:
- I found an old Belkin iPad Air bluetooth keyboard for $4. That's cheap enough to warrant testing my curiousity - and it works! The only problem is that the iPad needs to sit on the on/off button to work it, and it's too big for the keyboard...I'll have to find a workaround.
- I set up a NAS on my Linux tower, and mapped the hard drive containing my photos as a network drive in Windows. 

### Media 
- We have another Liberal *minority* government. The craziest part about this election is probably opposition leader Pierre Polievre losing his seat; a close second would be how close many of the ridings were. 
- The Ottawa Senators played strong in Game 5 and forced the series to a 6th game; unfortunately they couldn't keep it going and lost the series. They did well this year. 
- This past Friday was Bandcamp Friday! I wrote about it in my Friday thoughts post so I'll move on. 
- I found this website: [One Album A Day - 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die](https://1001albumsgenerator.com/) It's exactly what the title sounds like. You get a new album every day, and once you've listened to it you can jot down some thoughts about it if you like. 
	- Similar to this is [Crucial Tracks music journal](https://app.crucialtracks.org). You get one entry per day to write about anything you like. If you're stuck you can use a daily prompt.
