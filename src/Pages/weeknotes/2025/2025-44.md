### Things this week 
5 of 7 days this week were consumed by the World Series. There were a lot of ups and downs, and ultimately the Dodgers won Game 7 in 11 innings to beat the Blue Jays. At the time of writing, I'm taking a sports hiatus. I no longer wish to be tied up in sports, I need a break. I should be okay in a week and then I can get back into hockey. 

This week also marked the beginning of [Writing Month](https://writing month.org), a website created by the fantastic <a href="https://benjaminhollon.com/" class="nametag">Amin</a>. My project is to write a journal entry every day - of any length. This means I will have a *minimum* 30 entries; this also means I could end up with more if I write more than one in a day. Feel free to add me as a buddy (though I'm not sure how that works yet); my profile is [here](https://writingmonth.org/~srg84/). One of the methods I'm going to use to make sure I write something is to focus on three things that happened or I felt during the day, inspired by jarunmb's daily recap (see links below).

We brought our old TV over to my parents' house while they were away so that we could set it up unencumbered. It's much bigger than the TV they had, but also has the benefit of not having dead, black pixels in the middle of their screen. It might be too big for them, but at least it will help them determine the right size for them.

### Tech & Blog Stuff 
- My new Obsidian review setup is working as intended. It's now one file, updated daily & weekly through an automated script. It needed a few tweaks but I was able to do that from my phone via [Termius](https://termius.com/free-ssh-client-for-android).
- I saw a link to a blog with a really neat column layout (from Thefoggiest.dev - link is below). I really like it and would like to implement something similar somewhere; I'm not sure where or to what but I like the newspaper/magazine style. 
  - But that gave me an idea to modify some things for this website; in 2026 I'm moving the weeknotes to my [main blog](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev), but I want somewhere to feature some longer-form articles. I think that place is here, in a new page. Something I'm noodling about in the background.
### Media 
- I don't think I can write any more about sports. My weekly review is filled with Blue Jays stuff; the only thing I can add is that I scored games 6 and 7 on my iPad. I will share those along with game 1 in a final write-up sometime next week. While I was able to save last week's scorecards as images, I have yet to scan the handwritten scorecard. 
- In *Star Wars Outlaws* news, I finally unlocked a spaceship mission and I'm excited. However I decided to put it off for a little bit while I finish some side missions on Toshara and get some much-needed upgrades (skill-enhancing clothes, an extra health bar, etc.). 
   - There was one firefight I got into with a couple of smugglers where I was able to hide behind a rock, duck out from the side, and take some precision shots. It was like you see in a movie. It was a ton of fun and has given me some ideas for some of the other missions I've had trouble with.
- I started noting down books in my weekly review files, and they're starting to get lost in my archive folder. I need to create a list so I don't lose them. Most of these books are titles I might want to buy for myself, but also titles for others or my wife. 
### Links

- [More thoughts on alternative phone OSes |Thefoggiest.dev](https://thefoggiest.dev/2025/10/27/more-thoughts-on-alternative-phone-oses) - The site design on this page is fantastic, love the magazine / newspaper layout.
- [Why a Daily Recap? - jarunmb.com](https://jarunmb.com/posts/why-a-daily-recap) - I like this approach more than the two-sentence journal; the latter just isn't sticking for me.
