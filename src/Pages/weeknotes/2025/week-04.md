### Things this week 

- Tuesday, driving home from work, I witnessed so much "stupid" on the road that it baffled my mind that there wasn't a single collision along my way. There was one *very* close call, but ultimately nobody crashed into each other. The one major downside of my new work location. 
- We attended a 67's game Saturday afternoon - the first game this year we've been to where the team we're rooting for won.
- Went for a skate on the Rideau Canal; the ice conditions were great and the day was fantastic, but there was a lot of wind. Thankfully it died down after a little while. This was our first skate of the season. 

### Health Notes

- Personal training at the gym continues to go well. I haven't been the greatest with calorie counting (I'm OK with going over, as long as I don't do it every day), but I *feel* the results of the training. When I feel my ab muscles when I make a certain movement, I'm happy to realize that what I'm doing at the gym is translating to physical results. 
- I had a rash on my ring finger for the longest time but it seems to be healing ever since we had our wedding rings cleaned. There must have been something embedded in the band.
- Samsung health has a new mood tracker, testing it out. 

### Tech & Blog Stuff 

- I remember back in the days of the first generation of the iPod Touch, album art was a huge deal and hugely emphasized. I'm disappointed that the most recent iPod Touch (7th generation, running only iOS 15) - while not exactly minimizing album art - doesn't feature it more prominently. Apparently iPhones have the capability of enlarging album art on the lock screen but that's not possible in iOS 15. 
  - I feel like I should look into jailbreaking/modifying my iPod Touch at this point, but I'm weary of breaking its functionality. 
- I don't think I mentioned it but I set https://alternativeairwaves.com to auto-renew, so I'm keeping the domain. The Wordpress plan expires this year as well but I'm strongly considering moving it over to https://micro.blog. 
- I made a small change to the markdown frontmatter but that's all behind-the-scenes stuff that I realized I didn't need to do anymore. 

### Media 

- Borrowed [*Cinema Speculation* by Quentin Tarantino](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/bf67589f-d490-400e-8573-533eb3decd69) from the library; so far I'm enjoying it. I was concerned I would need a deep knowledge of the films he writes about, but that's not the case. It's very accessible. In just three essays you can also see what films have heavily influenced his own filmography. 
   - Also happy that he writes from a place of loving film, and not talking about his films or his experience as a writer/director.
- I'm also reading Michael Crichton's *The Great Train Robbery*. I'm not far into it but I love that while rooted in actual history, it's playing out like your standard heist story: putting a team together, casing the joint (or joints in this case), then eventually pulling off the heist. 
- *The Good Place*: pretty much a perfect ending. It hit all the right emotional beats. I'd watch it over again.
