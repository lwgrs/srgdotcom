### Things this week 
This is the week that according to everyone is the last week of summer. I guess technically if you revolve your summer season around going back to school, but currently we don't, so this was another fun week of summer. And a long weekend! We travelled mid-week and had to work remotely before starting the weekend but what a weekend. We went for a boat ride (with fishing; I caught the biggest), and had a bon fire. Monday we went on a photo shoot of sorts and I have a lot of photos to play with on my computer at home. Looking forward to creating a [contact sheet](https://www.capa.cx/) (kudos <a href="https://hiro.report" class="nametag">Hiro</a> for linking to that in his report this week). 
### Health Notes
The start of the week was tough, with my knee swelling like crazy and having to elevate and ice. It took almost to the end of the week before starting to feel normal.  Overall a good week, though! 
### Tech & Blog Stuff 
I discovered my Obsidian-related obsession is themes (for others it's plugins). The latest I'm trying out is called "Flexcyon" and I like the look of it a lot. Other than playing with themes I've also been playing with Lightroom presets. I found a neat [AI-based tool that creates Lightroom presets](https://presetgenerator.futc.de/) based on descriptions. The latest I'm trying is one I asked for to make photos look like the colour grading of *Asteroid City*. 
### Media 
The first of my Bandcamp packages arrived this week! It's a cassette tape and came in some [neat packaging](https://ottawa.place/@srgower/115097169632866176). I plan on writing a post about it later, with pictures. Haven't listened yet. 
Also in media: I watched some more *X-Files*, specifically S2 episode "Aubrey". The thought that came across my mind at the end: it would be nice if occasionally the solution to the episode wasn't necessarily paranormal or alien. 
And the last thing is that I discovered *The Best Laid Plans* is sort of laid out with daily diaries by one of the main characters and it happens to line up with the current date. I'm going to read it according to the matching date. So the next chapter I'm reading is Wednesday Sept 3rd.
