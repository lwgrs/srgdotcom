### Things this week 
This was, technically, the same length of week as any other. But because of the stat holiday (Victoria Day) the work week was shorter. I'm grateful for that - I needed a day off and it felt like a day off. I may have talked about this somewhere before. 

On Thursday I felt very beat up from softball, only 4 weeks into the season. My thumb was still hurting, and on Thursday my foot was incredibly sore when I woke up. What happened to me? (I'm over 40, that's what.) 

But as I write this I feel good, and my thumb is getting closer and closer to recovered. I can now carry weight with it, where a week ago I couldn't hold a simple tray of nachos. 

The most exciting thing that happened this week was going to Game 2 of the PWHL Finals, Minnesota Frost vs Ottawa Charge. The game went into overtime and it was thrilling. The result wasn't ideal, but we still had a fun time. 

I end with a final thought: does returning mail to sender for a previous occupant actually do anything? I pondered this as I almost threw out a piece of mail instead of marking it to RETURN and put it in the mailbox. 

### Health Notes
- been doing pretty well since Tuesday. Full blown cold this morning (Friday - mostly sore throat). Need to be careful at the gym, almost overdid it.
- we napped a LOT in the last 3 days. Clearly not sleeping enough + being sick 
	- almost caved and didn't log yesterday. Went back and made best guess estimates based on what we ate. 
	My scale weight dropped drastically two days ago and stayed there today. Is it real? I don't know yet.

### Tech & Blog Stuff 
I started the week completely breaking my server in many different ways. It started when I tried to link to a picture I uploaded to my `htdocs` folder in File Browser - the image below - and link to it in my daily note in Obsidian. The image was broken, so I investigated - my public-facing web page was down. What was going on? Anyway I made many attempts to fix it, and it ended up coming down to one extra line in my `httpd.conf` file that had to be removed, and everything worked again. And that was just Tuesday!

##### Other tech & blog things:
- created a Tasker task to sweep my daily notes into an archive folder. Will do something similar for Weeknotes and week review page but not in a hurry. Tested it this morning (26th) and it works flawlessly. 
- I found my phone to be very sluggish this week, so I deleted some apps, and some files. Made my phone a little snappier. Now also trying out Brave Browser for a bit.
- **blog**: I think I'm going to create a "share" tag for Echofeed; I can tag specific blog posts that I want to share, rather than send my whole blog feed to Echofeed.
- I turned off Blueksy + Mastodon notifications on my phone. I realized that I was being drawn in too much. My preference is to *choose* to open the app instead of being pulled into it.
- I also deleted Threads & Twitter *(X)* from my phone. I wasn't using either of them.
