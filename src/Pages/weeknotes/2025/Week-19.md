### Things this week 
I'm not feeling particularly loquacious this time around so I think I'm sticking to tried and true bullet points. 
- I reframed my to-do list this week to make sure I GTD. For example: "I *get* to play Spider-Man after I get through my list" vs "I *have* to complete my list before I can play Spider-Man"
- First softball game tonight! I hope I can hit the ball. 
	- I can definitely hit. Massive home run, over the netting and onto the other field. Unfortunately it was the 2nd home run in the inning, so it was an out
- Parking lot repair at the office, and we were asked to work from home if possible. I opted to take the train - worked out very well. Got to enjoy [It's Storytime with Wil Wheaton](https://wilwheaton.net/podcast/)
	- The final train station, Tunney's Pasture, is a busy hive of people who seem to know exactly where they're going.
	- I got an idea for some narrative nonfiction from my trip. Started writing it to get my ideas out, I'll continue working on it a bit. Probably will want someone to read it.
- Mundane excitement for the week: they began street sweeping on Friday! Sure sign of summer 
- Note to self for future notes: swap "Links" and "Things I Made" sections
### Health Notes
- Stayed on top of my health this week. Until Friday stayed at or under my calorie goal.
### Tech Stuff 
- The only thing I really want to highlight is the script I wrote to expedite finishing my colour contrast page - see blog post below 
- I upgraded my Linux tower RAM to 16GB. Next is an SSD upgrade but will switch to lower capacity to save \$\$
### Media 
- listened to Moist's 1996 album Creature. Really liked [Disco Days](https://app.crucialtracks.org/profile/srg/20250508).
- Finished the main story for *Spider-Man* (PS4) with days to spare before returning to the library. 
	- taking a break from story driven games as I'm too busy to play them in the summer 
- "I Want You (Fever)" by Momma is stuck in my head on loop. I don't mind.
- Photos: took a really nice photo with my phone, have edited it and will post it on the photo blog soon. Finally downloaded photos from April to post as well
### Things I Made This Week
- [Colour Contrasts - Complete | An Almost Anonymous Blog](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/colour-contrasts-complete/)
- Finished my entry for [Hyde's Over\/Under series](https://lazybea.rs/overunder/) - I'm up June 2nd
- Made a cool/silly video using clips from NHL 25, edited entirely on my phone. https://youtu.be/ZWfSSdnFbNY 
	- my friend pointed me to "Capcut" so will check that out
