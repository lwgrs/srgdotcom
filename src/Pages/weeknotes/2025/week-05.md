### Things this week 

- I made some cinnamon & brown sugar simple syrup this week for trying to make a mocktail. It turned out only okay; the syrup is fine, but I think I need a stronger ginger beer for what I was trying to make (I don't recommend Canada Dry) 
  - I tried something from The Artisan Drinks Co: Fiery Ginger Beer. It improved the mocktail.
- Sens vs Wild: We splurged last minute on tickets to see the Ottawa Senators play the Minnesota Wild. It was a great game and the Sens won 6-0.  
- Winterlude held a "mini" pow-wow and we went to check it out. It was nice, and "mini" is the right word. 

### Health Notes

- Struggling this week with calorie logging. My scale weight is not "cooperating" as a result. I'll right the ship, one week does not negate overall progress (even when it feels like it). 

### Tech & Blog Stuff 

- [Why We Ditched the Icon for External Links • Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/blog/why-we-ditched-the-icon-for-external-links) <- I think actually I like this argument for ditching it (forget the technial explanation behind why they removed it). I did it because I thought it was cool and The Cool Kids were doing it but there are some situations where I don't really want it and I do some manual workarounds. So as I type this (Friday) I'm commenting out the code on my sites for now. 
- I invested some time into Alternative Airwaves, tweaking the site theme (including changing the colour palette and switching to a different WordPress theme) and creating a new logo. I also wrote a re-introduction post (link below). 

### Media 

- *A Man on the Inside* - great show, not too many episodes. Works as a self-contained season but I'm sure there's another one on the way. A quote from the show I liked: 
> "It's how I feel. And I've had quite a bit of wine, so I'm saying how I'm feelin'" -- [Calbert](https://www.themoviedb.org/person/196179-stephen-mckinley-henderson) 

- [Tunde Adebimpe: Ozzy Osbourne except indie rock](https://tundeadebimpe.bandcamp.com/album/thee-black-boltz)
- Album rec: [*West Coast* by Studio](https://studio.bandcamp.com/album/west-coast-2 ) 
- Movie: [*Heat* (1995)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/949-heat) - I enjoyed this but I think it's a victim of hype; plenty of people heap tons of praise on the movie and some of it is deserved, but I didn't enjoy it *as much* as other people. However, it is entirely worth it for the coffee shop scene between Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. One negative I especially didn't like: Pacino seemed to be playing two different characters at different points in the movie. 
- Getting back into The Album Project (slowly)
