### Things this week 
I feel like this week flew by; I think because I was back in the office 4 days a week. It's a slower pace at home, even if the amount of work is the same. That, and you lose 1-2 hours a day commuting. I took the train + bus on Friday, to save a little bit on gas. I still have three more trips to and from work this week, as well as a trek out to a west-end field for softball, so I would like to prolong the life of the tank for a few more days. I used public transportation again today. I like the slower commute, gives me time to listen to podcasts or even just *think* for a bit when I listen to music. 

Last week was my first full week of using my new Wanderings notebook and I enjoyed it. I wrote about my experience at the end of the week - you can find the link below. 
### Health Notes
I really thought my legs had recovered from 7 games of softball in 3 days Monday morning, but when I took my first run to 1st base Tuesday night for a double-header of Fall Ball, I realized that no, my hamstrings were not ready. Somehow I was able to make it to 2nd for a double. And then later in the week I did a 330-pound sled pull...I'm not sure what I'm doing. 

I decided yesterday (Sunday) that I'm going to start another health challenge to get down to my goal weight. I have to noodle on it a bit more as to what I'm going to do, but I hope to have something in writing today. 
### Tech & Blog Stuff 
Taking the bus on Friday really pushed me toward buying a power bank. When I got to work my phone was already down to 54% by 11am. I thought about it before, after our trip to the hospital last month, but at the time I didn't think I had any real need for it. This pushed me over the edge. I wound up getting [this thing by Anker](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/anker-powercore-10-000-mah-dual-usb-power-bank-black/17920348), and it was on sale for $30! 

The bulk of the week was spent playing around with tech. Some highlights: 
- Discovered that there is something called "remote play" for the PS5, so I set it up on my iPad. I was happy to discover you can even do it with disc games. Thanks <a href="https://brandons-journal.com" class="nametag">Brandon</a>! 
- As I want to start rating things on a 20-80 grade scale, but still translate that to star ratings for the general public, I figured out how to do the conversion thanks to some help from LLMs. I created a formula in Obsidian Bases for future use but I wrote about it at length at the end of the week. 
- Commented out the "book" section of my [library vault](https://library.srgower.com), I'm moving my books primarily to my personal vault for internal use (combined with Goodreads / Booksidian). Will add books back as a showcase of what I own only. 
### Media 
Also thanks to Brandon, he recommended a game called *[Star Trek Resurgance](https://library.srgower.com/games/ps-5/star-trek-resurgence/)*, and while I wanted to get it on disc, it was on sale for $15 as a digital download. I'd rather have the disc version so I know it's mine, but I'm not upset about a $15 purchase - if I lose access to it, I won't be heartbroken; but I'm not spending $50+ on a digital game. Anyway it's very enjoyable so far, and a bit of a slower paced game - which is great. It's more of an interactive episode of Star Trek. It reminds me a lot of *Star Trek Lower Decks: Warp Your Own Way* in the CYOA portion. 

Also on Saturday, my wife and I finally watched *Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning* and *The Final Reckoning*, both of which I reviewed on the blog (should be posting later this morning). Short version: I enjoyed them both, the first part was better than the second. Also: a lot of knives!
