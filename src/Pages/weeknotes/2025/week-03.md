### Things this week 

- Vacation day on Monday! I had days to burn from 2024 and the way I like doing that is taking Mondays off in January. I intend on NOT having extra days to use in 2026. 
  - Naturally it's a "weather" day - snowing, expected 2-4 cm. Not the worst weather imagineable. 
- Got a new laptop at work on Tuesday. Mostly a smooth process except for my job-specific software. It took a bit to get going. 
- Trying to respond to bloggers directly when I read something I like
- Theme for 2025: put less pressure on myself 


### Media 

- Duran Duran, *Rio* - I saw a recommendation on a random thread on reddit, it was something like a thread for recommending great albums. I can't remember exactly, but I put it on my 'to listen' list and took a rip through it this week. It's certainly a good album! A lot of meticulous details in there. My only complaint - and this is not about the album - is that on Spotify when they have a remastered album, they have all of the tracks for the album and then another DIFFERENT version of the same songs so when you're done listening to the album, it keeps playing...but over again.
- [Soft Vein - Through Blinds](https://softvein.bandcamp.com/album/through-blinds) (via https://c.im/@jake4480/113844962122171356) - Jake recommended this one on Friday and it came on the heels of me listening to 1st Wave for a good portion of the morning, so this hit at the perfect time.

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them.

- Great job <a href="https://sunny.garden/@xavier_hm" class="nametag">Xavier</a> for the social media detox: [Journal #8: My own thoughts as commodities | Xavier H.M.](https://xavierhm.blog/journal-8-my-own-thoughts-as-commodities/)  
> Social media had taught me to treat my own thoughts as commodities. In taking a break from social media, I found more value in my thoughts and felt fulfilled in thinking them without having to put them up for sale.
