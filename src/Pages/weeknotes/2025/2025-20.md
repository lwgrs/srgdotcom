### Things this week 
There are few things greater than having a long weekend that truly feels like it's providing you with *actual* rest. That's the case for me as I've been doing 4 day in-office days for the past three weeks (instead of 3 in-office days), and by the time I get to Thursday it feels like it should be Friday. But it's not. With the day off Monday I feel like I can relax. 

The week started of very warm, and patios around the office were in full season. It made for some very comfortable softball nights as well. In fact, we had to put in our window air conditioner unit in the bedroom over the weekend. However, it cooled down considerably by Saturday night so we (gratefully) took it out. As I type this on Sunday evening it's pretty cold. Wild weather swings for late May. 

The biggest thing that happened to us was that we won tickets to see Game Four of the PWHL playoffs between Montreal and Ottawa! The place was **loud**. And after the game (which the Charge won, by the way) Bank Street - sorry, **Charge Avenue** - was in full celebration mode. It was amazing to witness. I don't think my luck will hold out for the Finals against Minnesota, but you never know! 

Saturday was a very good day. No notes. 

And to close off the week, we did some shopping on Sunday. The most significant investment was a new softball bat, but we also found some pretty bang-on birthday cards and gifts for my brothers and nephew tomorrow. 

And once again, it's a great feeling to know I don't have to work tomorrow. 
### Health Notes
Overall my health has been good. The scale weight hasn't moved much but I generally feel *good* which is my true measure. Although earlier this week felt very sleepy during the day at work, despite getting at least 8 hours of sleep. This is a bad time of year for sleep for me though, as softball tends to have later nights. Will need to be careful here. 

Beyond that I took a weekend break from food logging. 
### Tech & Blog Stuff 
I don't have a lot to say about tech; I haven't done much tinkering. Here's as much as I wrote for the notes: 
* still trying to puzzle out a self hosted webmail client.
* zkbro pointed me to Android app Automate, going to see what it can do
* Craft CMS - something to look into?
* Got Samsung's One UI7 this week; it's a lot better than most die-hard Samsung users would make you believe 
### Media 
The week capped off with turning on my PS5 to play NHL 25 for the first time in over a week; I had forgotten earlier in the week there had been a brief power outage (no more than 10 seconds). When I booted up the game for the first time today, I found all my saved games and settings were gone. Ah well. 

Other things this week: 
* Some interesting podcasts I'm listening to:
	* [Vine: Six Seconds That Changed The World - Podcast](https://www.globalplayer.com/podcasts/42L2tD/)
	* [Understood - Season 5: Who Broke the Internet? Hosted by Cory Doctorow](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/1353-the-naked-emperor)
* I recommend the cover of "The Waiting" by Marcus King
