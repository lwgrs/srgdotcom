### Things this week 
What a wild week. There were some developments on the personal front that changed quite a few things but now is not the time to get into those. One of the really fun things that we did (read: crazy) was a fly-in, fly-out day where we took a small airline. We left at 6:30 in the morning and got back after 10pm. The flight itself was only an hour, and the plane itself was tiny. There were two rows of individual seats - I think 16 or 18 total seats; you could see into the cockpit, which made for a really cool view during landing at night. The whole experience felt like taking a bus trip in the air, because they were so casual about the process. On one end, we didn't even need to pass through security. I recommend the experience but not if your flight is longer than an hour.
### Media 
**Books**
- Finished "The Best Laid Plans" (2007, Terry Fallis); the short review is: it was fun to read but the humour felt forced a lot of the time. 
- Continuing with "Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince" (2005, J.K. Rowling)
- Saw the trailer for the upcoming *Supergirl* - now want to check out the story it's based on, "Supergirl Woman of Tomorrow"
**Games**
- *NHL 26* is difficult enough for me to play (vs CPU), I realized it's nearly impossible via PS Remote Play. Timing is too important and I end up chasing the puck more often than not. I'm getting better when playing directly. 
- I'm getting better with *Star Wars Outlaws*. I completed a few missions/quests without aid of walkthroughs, and I'm enjoying hopping around different systems completing various contracts. Keeping track of what I'm working on gets difficult though. 
- Tried out Amazon Luna. Looking into the official controller, because the buttons don't quite match up with a PS5 controller.
