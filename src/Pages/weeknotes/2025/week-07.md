### Things this week 

- I spent the week in Toronto, and worked out of my company's head office. I walked to the office and back to the hotel each day I went in (Tuesday through Thursday). Healthy 20 minutes each way. 
- There was a big snowstorm Wednesday evening into Thursday morning. The roads definitely got nasty as the snow went on. Thursday I still went into the office - it was a ghost town. 
- 5am Thursday morning the hotel's fire alarm went off. The culprit: exhaust from a snow blower in the parking garage. At least it wasn't very cold out (just snowy).
- I didn't write much outside of my journal so this is a light week.
