### Things this week 
This week was spent away from home, working remotely. It was good. There were some days I didn't want to get up in the morning, and some days I had some very nice naps. It was a slower pace and I didn't venture too far from the house. 

We had decent weather, only two days with rain. And of course we returned home to the first big snow storm of the season; it remains to be seen if this snowfall sticks around or melts in a few days. 
### Tech 
- I was able to get [RoundCube](https://roundcube.net) up and running on my server. Nice to be able to view my emails in a browser. Used step-by-step instructions from Claude (AI)
- tried a new Obsidian app called [Quick Draft](https://quickdraftcapture.app/); it's very interesting. It does what it says: allows you to write some quick text and it saves to your vault. Considering including it in my workflow; need to play around with settings.
### Media 
- Played a lot of *Star Trek Resurgence* using remote play this week. Now 3 hours in. Forgot how fun it is - even though it's more passive. Good break between games 
- Learned that there is a 40th anniversary *Back to the Future* 4K box set. How did I not know this before? 
- Yeah, I'd love to have this set...but it's way too expensive. [Lego boldly goes into the Star Trek universe with $400, 3,600-piece Enterprise-D - Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/11/lego-boldly-goes-into-the-star-trek-universe-with-400-3600-piece-enterprise-d/)
