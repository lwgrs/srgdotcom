### Things this week 
We're in the last week of August and I already spotted some leaves turning colour. But that's looking ahead, and it's time to look at the week that was - #34. 

The week started on a sour note; for the second week in a row our milk carton didn't open properly. That's annoying in itself, but then I discovered the carton had a small leak. Ugh. Usually when this happens I just pour in the previous carton, but as established, that one didn't open properly...at least the milk wasn't sour. 

And Wednesday night our softball season ended - we were eliminated in the playoffs. Still have one more Monday (tonight) and Tuesday (tomorrow), and then tournament Sept 5-7; and Fall Ball after that. It's not over yet. 

Oh, I made one of the notebooks for my wife's anniversary gift. It turned out well, but I was disappointed that I needed to reinforce the spine with additional cardstock. The needle work messed up the decorative cardstock a little bit, and I didn't want to leave it exposed like that. I felt like it might rip further. Luckily I had enough of the inside cover cardstock leftover so it still matches. For the last book I think I'm going to use elastic binding so the spine should be OK. 
### Health Notes
Tough week for the 75 day health reset. I logged either incomplete or nothing at all on Saturday & Sunday. Middle of the week was tough too, as my wife was in the hospital (she's OK! just needed stitches after taking a bad bounce during softball). I've been despondent through the week as my weight went up and got stuck at 247 until this morning. Not sure where I'm going to end up [by the end of next week](https://lwgrs.cloud/countdown/).  
### Tech & Blog Stuff 
Obsidian "Bases" core plugin was officially released this week, and predictably [reddit.com/r/ObsidianMd](https://reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD) was turned into a celebration of the new feature, with people showing off all their uses and people asking the same questions over and over. Do they do sticky threads there? I don't know (except they actually don't work but let's not talk about that). It's fun to play with and my first impressions can be summed up with "I like it". I look forward to when Digital Garden supports the plugin, but at the moment it works internally for me and I'm enjoying testing it out. 

As noted below I found a link to some really neat web applications for photo editing and one of my favourites was this AI-based tool to turn a description of the type of look you want into a Lightroom preset. I have a bunch that I edited quickly and I think that'll be my next [photo blog](https://photos.srgower.com) post.
### Media 
I finished Lee Child's *Die Trying*, the second Jack Reacher novel. I rated it 2 stars, but it was enjoyable enough. It was a page-turner and a quick read, and a good break between books. I don't think I'd read another one. I also wanted to play some more *[MLB The Show 24](https://franchise.lwgrs.cloud)* but since I also wanted to score the game (home opener) I didn't have enough time to devote to it. Another time.
