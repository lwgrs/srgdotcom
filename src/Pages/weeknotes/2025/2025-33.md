### Things this week 
I don't know how to judge this week overall. It started off rough, feeling like I needed a mental health day on my way to work. What happened was - I forgot my pills at home and had to turn back around; so I added half an hour to my day. But once I got to work things improved. I had a lot of introspective writing (both offline and online) and shared some back and forth thoughts with <a href="https://veronique.ink" class="nametag">Véronique</a>, which I will blog about this week (I asked permission). 

I didn't get to as much notebook making, as my wife was not away ;) But I did some prep work for the book I'm making for her. 
### Health Notes
I figured out the milestone dates for my health reset. The 60-day mark is tomorrow (August 19), and the last day is September 3rd. It's going well, or at least better than it feels day-to-day. I looked at it from a wider lens and it looks better that way. 
### Tech & Blog Stuff 
- I made a dumb countdown timer for my 75 day health reset (with help from Copilot): https://lwgrs.cloud/countdown/
  - Again with help from Copilot I added some styling this morning. It's a countdown for my 75-day health reset. 
- I've heard from multiple sources about a Linux application called "Immich" - in conjunction with Tailscale to make photos available anywhere.  
- Paid for Pagecord premium; playing around with it. I like being able to email posts. 
### Media 
- I *devoured* Alec Guinness' *A Commonplace Book*. I really enjoyed it and wrote a little about it (see below). 
  - By sheer luck, I found a copy of one of his books, *A Positively Final Appearance*, at Value Village (Savers in the US). 
  - I think I want to pick up my own copy for my shelf; I found an inexpensive option, will take a look later.
- We saw *Freakier Friday* Saturday night; it was enjoyable. I'm not intimately familiar with the original so I didn't catch all the callbacks, but I feel that it stands on its own without falling back on the original (like "do you remember when this happened in the original movie?" type of thing). 
- I finished the first adventure path in *Star Trek Lower Decks: Warp Your Own Way* - managed to destroy the *Cerritos* on my first run 
- Over the weekend had a very [satisfying blowout win](https://franchise.lwgrs.cloud/game-logs/g07-2024-04-03-blue-jays-at-astros/) in *MLB The Show 24* 
- On Sunday, I tried out digital scorekeeping on my iPad. Blogged about the results (below).
