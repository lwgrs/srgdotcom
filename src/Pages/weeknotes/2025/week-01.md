This is such a weird week to recap. It feels like a *long* time passed between December 30th and January 5th. But at the same time, it felt very quick. Does that make sense? At any rate it makes for a hard recap for the week, because it also feels like I will be covering things that happened the week before. I'm sure noone will hold it against me.

### Things This Week 

- We went to this amazing antique/flea shop type place called "Relic House". It features 12+ vendors in 12 rooms. A lot of cool things. Not everything was my cup of tea, but it was fun to browse. 
- When watching Wayfair commercials recently, they remind me so much of The Good Place with their "Waybourhood" spots. 
- I tried making simple syrup using Splenda yesterday! It was successful. I need to try it with iced coffee, because it doesn't do very much for hot coffee compared to a regular splenda packet. 
- I wrote this in [Notesnook](https://notesnook.com) this week; I'm trying out different workflows this year and this is my first attempt. 
- Thinking about publishing my week notes on Sundays instead of Mondays. It makes more sense to me to publish the recap of the week that was at the *end* of the week rather than the beginning of a new week.

### Media 

- I bought a new record player! It's not top-of-the-line by any means, but it's an upgrade from our previous machine (a suitcase model from Crosley). I ended up going with the [Crosley Scout](https://www.crosleyradio.com/scout-record-player-cr6042a) - the sound quality is definitely an upgrade, although it might not be the *best* sound available across record players. 
- One of the things I thought of doing for 2025 was clearing my watch list across various streaming platforms. The idea was to just be ruthless and cut out anything I hadn't watched yet. It worked...somewhat well. I cleared out a few things but there were some titles that I still actually want to watch. So at least I pruned a little bit. 
- I cancelled my Apple Music subscription, sticking with Spotify. I'll probably write more about that. 
- Will write about it later this week but my "year of not tracking" has started. I have a pile of books I want to get through but I don't feel any pressure to read a certain amount now.

### Links 

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them. 

- I want to look into this one some more: [The 1000 word Save Wisdom Questions. – SaveWisdom.org](https://savewisdom.org/the-1000-word-save-wisdom-questions/) 
- Possibly the greatest MP3 player I've ever seen: [Mixxtape](https://paulthings.com/) 
- I found this via <a href="https://louplummer.lol/" class="nametag">Lou Plummer</a>" [Tips on Using LLMs (AI) Effectively for Text – The Brooks Review](https://brooksreview.net/2024/08/tips-on-using-llms-ai-effectively-for-text/) 
- [it’s in a book – WIL WHEATON dot NET](https://wilwheaton.net/2025/01/its-in-a-book/) - I can't remember why I copied this link but I think it's related to Wil's mention of "seasons" of life. But there's also a book recommendation in there that I copied down to my list.
