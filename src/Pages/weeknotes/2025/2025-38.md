### Things this week 
It was a second week of working in the office 4 days instead of 3; I bussed on Monday again as I want to give our car a break from a busy summer (driving into the office 3 days a week PLUS driving around the city for softball games). The walk/train/bus option continues to serve me well. It probably won't always be so but I'm a realist, so I'll be fine if there's the occasional snag. 

My wife and I celebrated our 3-year wedding anniversary on Wednesday; we didn't do anything special - a nice dinner. I finally gave her the notebooks I made for her and she loved them. She got me a nice sweater and a watch, but even better a neat picture frame that has three frames on a hinge. In the centre are our wedding vows, and pictures of us on either side. It was a great gift. 

To end the week I had two wasps in the house. One was mercifully at the front door, and I was able to let him fly out on his own. The other is still somewhere in the kitchen. I don't know where. I'm going to be paranoid about it first thing Monday morning.
### Health Notes
- Started a new 30-day weight loss goal. I got so close to my goal at the end of my 75-day health reset, so I want to push to get the rest of the way. 
### Tech & Blog Stuff 
- At the beginning of the week I had a mysterious problem with my Linux tower - it wouldn't connect to my home wifi network. It would connect to my phone's hotspot though. I had several rounds of troubleshooting but in the end it miraculously just...worked? I'm not touching a single setting again.
- Stupid Obsidian stuff: I found out about math/latex blocks. They're rather neat. I have no practical use for them but when has that stopped me?
### Media 
- Finished *Fahrenheit 451* this week; picked out some new stuff to read 
- Sloan's "Based on the Best Seller" CD arrived in the mail this week! There are even liner notes! A rarity. Haven't listened yet (but plan to Monday)
- Re-watched *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014) and it remains as good as ever. What helps is that the villain is not an outlandish cartoon figure, and the main story remains relevant. If you haven't seen it, watch it; and you don't need to have watched any of the other Marvel movies to enjoy it.
