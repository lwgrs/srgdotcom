### Things this week 
I posted on Mastodon that I have felt disconnected from the Fediverse and blogging community lately. I think it's mostly because I have been busy at work, combined with being in the office more often than not. I almost didn't want to bother putting up my Weeknotes but it's almost 7am as I type this and I've been awake for a couple of hours now so I'm killing some time. 
### Health Notes
- haven't made much progress getting to my weight goal but overall still feeling good
### Tech & Blog Stuff 
- Did a lot of work on my [media library vault] (https://library.srgower.com) this week; mostly cleaned up properties and set up some new pages
- backed up my Obsidian vaults onto a USB drive. Will try to do this on a regular basis
### Media 
- most of my media consumption has been split between MLB playoffs (Blue Jays have a hole to dig out of in the ALCS, down 2-0 vs Seattle) and playing *Star Wars Outlaws*
### Links 
[Shared Links on Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/srgower/shared-links-56296964) - here's what I added this week. 
- [Prompts for your two-sentence journal | De minimis non curat Lex](https://alexanderbjoy.com/two-sentence-journal-prompts/) - Interesting methodology re: two-sentence journal, which I read more about after reading this post. The prompts are helpful.
- [Apparently modern DVD releases are worse than they were 20 years ago](https://birchtree.me/blog/apparently-modern-dvd-releases-are-worse-than-they-were-20-years-ago/) - Neat thing I hadn't read about before.

### Things I Made This Week
