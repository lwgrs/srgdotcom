### Things this week 
This week has felt very weird. It started off like any other - working in the office, softball the first three days. But then the whirlwind starts: Thursday I drove out dog to my wife's parents (about an 8 hour drive), so that the next day I could fly out to Halifax to meet my wife to fly together to Happy Valley-Goose Bay, in Labrador (of Newfoundland & Labrador). 

This had the effect of splitting my week into two: the Ontario half, and the Labrador half. I'll have to write a blog post about the Labrador part, just too much in this space. 

Our Tuesday softball game was streamed live over Facebook, so I downloaded the video and edited it down to our at-bats and a few plays in the field. I'm not quite done with it - I have the clips in place I'm just not sure about the sound yet. I'm using [VN Video Editor](https://www.vlognow.me/) on my Android; it seems they have iOS apps and maybe desktop software, so I'll have to look into these for easier editing.

Last thing: my over/under with Hyde is [up today](https://lazybea.rs/ovr-021/)!
### Health Notes
I was very tired the first few days of the week. Like unable to properly operate at work. All three days I worked, I went down for a nap when I got home. I'm not sure of the cause, but I know I got plenty of good sleep in Goose Bay. 

My best guess is that it was the remnants of the cold I developed last week. Other than some final "leakiness" I've kicked that, thankfully it didn't last long. 

Other than that, I took a food logging break and will get back to it on Tuesday. 
### Media 
The number one piece of media I enjoyed this week was the radio station tuned in the rental car: [Big Land - Labrador's FM](https://bigland.fm). The station has a mix of several different kinds of music. 

Beyond that I watched a lot of *X-Files* season 2 over the last four days. Travelling alone will do that to you.
### Links 
Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them.
- [92,000 Lego bricks later, this model of the Chi-Cheemaun was born in brick form \| CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/92-000-lego-bricks-later-this-model-of-the-chi-cheemaun-was-born-in-brick-form-1.7542314)
- [Good Internet Magazine](https://goodinternetmagazine.com/) launched this week. Thinking of purchasing a digital copy (would like a physical edition but shipping is too prohibitive for me).

- <a href="https://veronique.ink" class="nametag">Veronique</a> has a great idea to [use Raindrop](https://veronique.ink/an-8-page-mini-zine-dear-karla/) to share links instead of adding them to posts individually and losing to the sands of time. I like this idea!

### Other Notes 
Nothing consequential, but I decided to turn off notifications for Mastodon + Bluesky on my phone. I felt I was getting pulled into the apps everytime I saw a mention. I prefer opening them with intentionality, on my own terms.
