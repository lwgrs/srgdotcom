### Things this week 
This was a rough week in terms of being busy and being creative. I find it tough to do a lot of writing during the day (and yet, I still found some time to write). If I wasn't so busy with work this would probably bother me a lot more. 

Speaking of work, I found out Thursday that they're mandating us back to the office 4 days a week by October, 5 by February. I shouldn't be too surprised. 

Two more things: I made another notebook this weekend. This time I was testing binding it with thead. I made a B6 sized book that opens up to B5; but the trimming process really mucked it up. 

I also had an idea for some cassette mixtapes based on edited CBC Radio 3 podcasts. I recorded my first one, I'll share them later. I hope to put physical tapes up for sale.
### Health Notes
I haven't reviewed my week yet as far as the health reset goes. I feel good in general. I biked to the baseball game on Sunday - that went well! 
### Tech & Blog Stuff 
- Trying out [Lumo](https://lumo.proton.me), a new LLM from Proton. Found it via <a href="https://www.hiro.report/" class="nametag">Hiro</a>
- While editing the cassette mixes I solved an audio problem I was having on my MacBook in relation to using [Reaper](https://reaper.fm) that pitched audio down when playing over Bluetooth speakers. It was a sample rate problem. 
### Media 
My top thing this week was attending two baseball games! Both were a lot of fun and had a lot of action. The [Titans](https://ottawatitans.com) went 1-1 for the games I saw but won the series overall 2-1. 

My 75-day health reset is proving helpful for finishing books. I finished *The Wake* this week, on Wednesday. I don't think I would have finished it for a while longer if I didn't push myself to read even a little bit every day. Next up for reading is *Die Trying* (the second Jack Teacher novel) and I'm doing the same thing - a little bit each day. 

I watched a lot of movies and TV this weekend: 
- *What Lies Beneath* (2000)
- *Slow Horses* season 1 
- *Star Trek First Contact* (1996)
