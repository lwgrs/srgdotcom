My week notes - a little bit early this time around. 

I mentioned last week that I wanted to change up my Weeknotes format; I haven't quite figured out what that looks like yet, but I did change my method for putting them together this week. I created a "daily note" where I would record any and all thoughts and happenings through the week. This allowed me (the theory here) to review what I noted down and distill down to what I want to highlight from the week. 
### Things this week 

This week started with a major snow dump on Monday followed by four straight days of nothing but sun. The snow was far too much to handle, and now with everything melting it's all muddy and gross. Still, I'll take it over snow. 

I've been taking part in the "Cool Bloggers Walking Club" ([Cool Bloggers Walking Club – The Optimistic Musings of a Pessimist](https://optimisticmusings.com/category/cool-bloggers-walking-club/)); the simple goal is to walk 10 minutes every day in April. This is normally something "in the bag" for me because I walk my dog, but we're staying with my in-laws this week and sometimes it's easy to take the dog out far enough for her to do her business and come back, or just put her on the leash outside. So far - 100% with ten minute walks every day. I'm tracking my progress as a mini zine; I'll share pictures of it in May.

Saturday: all the time in the world to myself, and a bright sunny day. The only inkling of a plan is(was?) to take the camera out. But it was nice to spend a bit of the morning with a coffee and reading through my RSS feeds, lazily following rabbit holes as I click on links from the posts.

At the end of the week I had an internal debate: cut my crazy hair, or wait it out a few more weeks and get it done before softball season? I think I'll hold off until softball.
### Health Notes

For most of the week I've been dealing with a cold: lots of congestion that seemed like it would never end. Near the end of the week it lightened up; and while I traded a cold for back pain, the swap came around again. Cruel.
### Tech & Blog Stuff 

- I use the app [Cashew](https://cashewapp.web.app/) to manage finances/budgets on the go; I thought I figured out this week how to effectively use CSV files to make it easier to enter data but I messed up some date formatting - work in progress.
- New Mastodon filters: `Carney`, `Polievre`, and updated my general politics filters to include `#stocks` and revised `trump` to not match exact case (to catch potential hashtags)
- I'm having trouble fixing my father-in-law's computer; he keeps getting one of those fake Windows Defender scam pop-ups and I'm having a hard time nailing down the source. It doesn't help that his solution to getting rid of it is turning off the power bar (which in turns powers off the Internet)
- Trying to get some more use out of my iPad; playing around with focus modes / different home screens. There's much more I can probably do, I'm just digging in!
- <a href="https://html-chunder.neocities.org/" class="nametag">zkbro</a> had an interesting link in his [quick post earlier today](https://html-chunder.neocities.org/quick-post/202504121114/) - Bash Static Site Generator (BSSG). I can see myself making use of this with my OpenBSD server.

### Media 

- Finished *Bad Cree*, working on a review at the moment 
- Also finished *Star Trek Lower Decks* volumes 1-3 from Hoopla
- Finally finished S1 of *X-Files*; it was very up-and-down but overall I enjoyed it. 
- Also polished off some videos from my YouTube Watch Later list - happy to have it cleared.
