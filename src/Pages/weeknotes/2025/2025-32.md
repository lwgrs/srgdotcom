### Things this week 
It was a short week because of the holiday Monday, and the first week at work without two people on my team who have been there for many years. My Tuesday started knowing that we were approved to add two people (1 in another department, 1 in mine) and ended with knowing that one person in the other department is shifted to me, meaning I'm not hiring anybody (I'm fine with that) and we're hiring two in the other. Whirlwind.

My weekend was dominated by crafting notebooks. By Sunday I created three notebooks as part of a pack for my wife's anniversary gift, in September. The next one I'm going to make (and I'm making one, for certain) is going to have a nice cover and will be the bigger of the four (so far). 
### Health Notes
I really haven't been keeping up with my 75-day challenge. I really don't even know how many days I'm at. I'm reviewing all of that information tonight.
### Tech & Blog Stuff 
- Upgraded my MacBook Pro (13 inch, mid 2012) to MacOS Ventura; that's the most stable release that's reported to work well on that model. I have a 1TB SSD and 16GB of RAM, which seems to be the consensus for getting the most out of it. Unless the hardware dies I've got quite a few years left in this thing. 
- Discovered that [Lumo chats](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/testing-lumo-by-proton/) are only saved for 7 days with the free tier. That's a bummer. 
- And for Obsidian I'm trying out the latest trendy theme: **Baseline**. It's opinionated design, that's for sure.
### Media 
- caught up with a bunch of things:  
	- X-Files S2E11 (not very good)  
	- Shot in the Dark E2 & 3 (really compelling and the second episode opens with a stringer saving someone's life)
- It was recommended to me to watch *Star Trek Voyager* episode "11:59" - it was really great, down to Earth (literally) and didn't involve "tech-ing the tech". Watch it!
- found a browser based web app to track TV watching. Source is available on GitHub: [GitHub - tvshowtracker/tv](https://github.com/tvshowtracker/tv)
	- It's entirely browser-based and unique to the user, so even if I told someone the URL I'm using nobody would see my list
- Went to an Ottawa Titans game, and scored it; great game, the Titans won 8-3
