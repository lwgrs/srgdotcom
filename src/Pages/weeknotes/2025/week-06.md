### Things this week 

- There must be some universal rule about books on hold at the library being available to check out at the least convenient time. A book I placed a hold on - that was well behind the queue - is available for check-out but I won't be able to get to it before the hold expires (Feb 12).

### Health Notes

- Naturally, the week before I'm supposed to be working in head office with my manager, I've got a sore throat. *Hopefully* this means I'll be healthy (healthy-*ish* at minimum) next week. 
  - The sore throat became congestion within a day or two and with it incredible tiredness. Not a terrible thing for recovery I suppose.

### Tech & Blog Stuff 

- [An interesting post](https://cosocial.ca/@f_beaudet/113952711588172502) from <a href="@f_beaudet@cosocial.ca" class="nametag">Francis Beaudet</a>; my macbook hasn't received OS updates in quite some time but didn't know something known as `#OpenCoreLegacyPatcher` existed. Something I need to look into now. 

### Media 

- Finished reading *[Cinema Speculation](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/bf67589f-d490-400e-8573-533eb3decd69)* by Quentin Tarantino. I'm surprised to learn that this is his only published collection of film essays. I thought it was an interesting look into the films that left enormous impressions on Tarantino that would ultimately lead to the movies he's famous for.
