### Things this week 
We came back from a trip to Newfounland & Labrador on Monday, and even though our trip was quick - just two & a half days in Happy Valley - Goose Bay - it felt like so much longer. It took so long to get back into our regular routine last week (and we would later shake it up some more by going on another quick weekend trip to my in-laws - but that's another thing entirely). The very first thing I did when we got back (after a long nap) was get our photos off the camera and downloaded to the photo hard drive.

The biggest barrier to doing *anything* with photos is getting them off the camera. My coworkers wanted to see my pictures so that pushed me even further to pick and choose shots to put into an album. So that's done, and that means not only do I know which photos to print for an album or frames, but I know which ones to pick for my photo blog. 
### Health Notes
The most significant thing that happened health-wise this week was that I had my yearly follow-up appointment with my neurologist to see how I'm doing with regard to my epilepsy diagnosis. Overall, things are good. I still have occasional bouts where I have difficulty with language comprehension (thankfully, not as often as it used to be), but I still have moments where it's difficult for me to focus and I lock in on a certain phrase and hear it everywhere, but can't pinpoint what the phrase is. It's hard to describe but some day, I will try. 

Most importantly I have been seizure free for 2 years. As I write this today it's 2 years + 4 days. I am extraordinarily lucky to be doing this well and I don't take it for granted. 

The only unexpected development was that I shocked my doctor when I told her I was taking a dose of [lamotrigine](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/20217-lamotrigine-tablets) higher than what was prescribed; it must have been a misunderstanding on my part. Still, I find it's been helping reduce the language comprehension issues and I haven't experienced side effects, so we're going to stick with the higher dose. 
### Tech & Blog Stuff 
I read an interesting post about photography (link below) that got me thinking about how I shoot photos in relation to what I do with them after. I've known for a while that other than some straightening and cropping, I like how my photos turn out on my Sony a5000 on the default modes. Similarly when I use the priority settings, the photos turn out rather well. Do I need to save RAW photos for the most part? Probably not. The only occasion where I would want to at the moment might be shooting in Pro mode on my phone, because the camera and settings just aren't as good as the Sony. 
### Media 
- *The Creative Act* by Rick Rubin became available from the library, so I borrowed the eBook. The sentences are short and punchy so I suspect it won't take my long to read. Is this book for me, though? Not sure yet. 
- My wife and I started watching **High Potential** last night and it's a fun show! It's sort of like Sherlock Holmes...so not a new concept but they're bringing different story beats to the show. Apparently it's based on a French show with the same name. 
### Links 
Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them.
