### Things this week 

- My birthday was this past Wednesday! I turned 41. I took the day off, and so did my wife, as she took off on a work trip the next day. 
  - I forgot again - I share the same birthday with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brownknowser.bsky.social" class="nametag">Ross Brown</a>, AKA [The Brown Knowser](https://rossbrownfoot.blogspot.com/)
  - I had a great day. We had no plans beyond a 12pm gym appointment with our personal trainer. I played some video games (see below), and did some major work on my diamond art project. Then we went out for dinner! 
- I worked on my diamond art project. As of Friday night it's almost finished - then I can finally move on to another project. Most likely a LEGO set.
- On Friday I ordered some non-alcoholic beer from a local shop that specializes in non-alcoholic versions of beer and wine and spirits etc. I got two of my favourites (Sober Carpenter's Black IPA) and some new ones. I drank two of them already and I intend to write a review. I need to do it fast while the flavour is fresh, because I only bought one of each can of what I drank. 

### Health Notes

- I was perhaps a little optimistic that I got back on the calorie logging horse last weekend. I started strong on Monday, but faltered on Tuesday. For Birthday Wednesday I just didn't bother. 
  - Still haven't got back to it. Will try again Monday morning. 
- Friday morning I woke up with a nasty headache and felt like I had to throw up. It took me a while to wake up, but I eventually pushed through it. I don't know what brought it on - too much bad food the night before?

### Media 

- I started playing *Star Trek Online* - I guess this was a PS4 title? Anyway it was free to "purchase" so I got it a couple weeks ago. I finally played it this week and in my first TOS mission I had a great red shirt experience. On point game. Apparently the game takes you to Deep Space Nine at some point...so I guess I'm playing *STO* now. 
- I've taken to uploading gameplay recordings to my YouTube channel. It started as a means to an end to embed a video in a [post about my first impressions of the PS5](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/ps5-first-impressions/), and probably my next video is going to be used for a similar purpose: [Home Runs in MLB The Show Beginner Mode](https://youtu.be/Z1wNTCq-49A?si=VwuyI5C3bQV-Gujx). Perhaps I may continue to upload random videos! 
- I briefly toyed with the idea of streaming only Canadian music out of some misguided feeling of patriotism. I can't do it. There's just so much good music out there that spans nationality. Plus it doesn't seem right to punish those who aren't responsible for what's going on. 
  - HOWEVER I did browse exclusively Canadian music on [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com) for **Bandcamp Friday**. I was pleased to find out <a href="https://danmangan.bandcamp.com/music" class="nametag">Dan Mangan</a> has a new album coming out to pre-order - so that was an immediate buy for me; the only decision was vinyl vs. CD for a physical copy. I opted for the vinyl, so that'll be a nice treat in the mail!
- I watched *Woman of the Hour*, Anna Kendrick's directorial debut. It was just OK. Kendrick didn't bring anything really special to either the director's chair or as an actor in the film, but it looked good. 
- I spent the weekend listening to a bunch of CDs on full random, 5 at a time in the CD changer. Once again I'm reminded that Sloan's best-of album, *A Sides Win*, is really good. 

### Tech & Blog Stuff 

- I decided to give Niagara Launcher a go on my phone. I like Samsung OneUI, but I figured trying something different can't hurt. I'll try to give it 7 days, at least (that's Niagara's recommendation). 
- Photos for this week's photography composition challenge are taken, I just need some time to edit them before sharing. Will do that Monday, probably.

### Things I Made This Week

- [Thursday Thoughts 01 | An Almost Anonymous Blog](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/thursday-thoughts-01/)

### Links 

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them.

- [try the year compass! | dearmishmash](https://dearmishmash.bearblog.dev/try-the-year-compass/) - I don't think I'm going to try it myself, but a cool concept. 
- [The fear of being seen](https://gobino.be/the-fear-of-being-seen/) - I relate to this so much! I feel so self-conscious whenever I take photos - even when it's not of people.
