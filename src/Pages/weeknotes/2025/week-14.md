I want to set up a different format for weeknotes. Not sure what that looks like yet. For now - here's the usual format.

### Things this week 

- Added `#cdnpolli` and `#cdnpoli` to my Mastodon politics filters. 
- I spoke to some college students about my job! I've been speaking to students in the program I graduated from for several years now, but it seems this will be the last: the college has "suspended" the Radio Broadcasting program. 

### Health Notes

- I'm sick with a cold! Again! 3rd time this year. This time around it's a bit different in terms of symptoms. But I took a sick day on Tuesday because I didn't want to deal with work. 
- I started tracking daily 10 minute walks as part of the Cool Bloggers Club, an unofficial challenge for the month of April. It's dead simple: walk at least 10 minutes daily for the whole month. 

### Media 

- Hitting "pause" on *Spider-Man* (PS4). It's due back at the library and can't renew it (too many holds on it). I'll pick it back up at a later date. 
- I want to like Haim's song "Relationships" but while I like the structure and music arrangement, I'm not a fan of the lyrics and what the song seems to be about. 
- A teaser trailer for the new *Naked Gun* movie (starring Liam Neeson) came out; it looks fun! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8-N8IIq_8I
- [This play right here](https://youtu.be/p3isXBso_BU?si=QeBECHnQuFrExEsl) - so many things went the right way. 1) I struck out, but the catcher dropped the ball; 2) the catcher overthrew to 1st; 3) I turned to run to 2nd but had to turn back. Forgot the button to do that and stood still while the second baseman approached. Still made it to 1st safely. 


### Things I Made This Week
- [Favourite Numbers | An Almost Anonymous Blog](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/favourite-numbers/)
- [Updating an Outdated Macbook Pro | An Almost Anonymous Blog](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/updating-an-outdated-macbook-pro/)


### Links 

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them. 
- [The Luxury of Analogue | Mike Grindle](https://mikegrindle.com/posts/analogue)
- [Video Game Backlog Zero – Tyler Sticka](https://tylersticka.com/journal/video-game-backlog-zero/) - Sounds similar to book backlogs! (Side note - this blog is neat, take a look at it in a browser)
- [How to Install, Activate, and Update Obsidian Plugins | by Stephan Miller | Medium](https://archive.ph/VGeq0) - I'm enjoying Obsidian and now finding plugins that will further enhance my experience. This was helpful for figuring out how to install them.
