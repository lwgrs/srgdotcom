### Things this week 

- In trying to be resourceful and do my own work of flipping an electrical outlet around, I inadvertently created a fire hazard and my landlord had to come over and fix it. Woops. But all is well now and things are set up as intended. And no fire happened. 
- I know in a lot of cases hybrid work setups make no sense and a lot of people hate them if they can get the same work done at home - but I love it. On Tuesday I had a productive talk with one of my coworkers and we solved a problem together, in person. 
- Hiro's assignment for us this week for the composition challenge is to use the golden spiral/ratio when composing your shot. This isn't something I've considered much before. 
- Diamond Art is forever: I bought some mod podge to seal the canvas; it's going to take a while. Probably not as long as putting it together in the first place, but...
	- I'm still going to start my next project soon: a LEGO set

### Health Notes

- I messed up my [notes](/weeknotes/2025-week-11/) from last week; I should have mentioned EVERY DAY was complete in Cronometer.
- I moved up my blood donation from April 4th to March 19th. I can't donate blood on training days (Mondays and Fridays).
- Monday to Thursday were all complete days for food logging. Friday was a partial day, and Saturday/Sunday were a conscious choice not to log. 
	- It's important to me to take occasional breaks. Good for my mental health. 

### Media 

- I'm so glad <a href="https://brandons-journal.com" class="nametag">Brandon</a> recommended I play through *Spider-Man* (PS4) before moving onto *Spider-Man 2* (PS5). I've played about an hour (as of writing this) and it's so much fun.
	- I'm falling down the video game rabbit hole. Found a couple of games I'm interested in: *Star Trek Resurgence* and *Star Wars Outlaws*. The latter is available from the library at least!
- I finally found a remixed version of Steppenwolf's *Magic Carpet Ride* that I've been trying to find for quite some time: ["Magic Carpet Ride - Steir's Mix"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3qhq2yD8nQqtO2cOHjnDix?si=PBgBM2H0QoyN0Np5-fiAzw&context=spotify%3Aplaylist%3A37i9dQZF1E8PXQFFGMTIlH)
- I finally got to Deep Space Nine in *Star Trek Online*. Once I found out that was possible, that's all I wanted to get to. I'm going to come back to the game later, but I'm going to put it aside for now. I took some video and screen captures and I'm probably going to take more.

### Tech & Blog Stuff 


- Progress with the self-hosted server: it's all good to go. I have some tweaks to make to my Syncthing setup but it's otherwise working flawlessly. Next step is trying to set up Miniflux, and perhaps attempting setting up File Browser (Sylvia's guide is intense)
- I wrote these notes in Obsidian, mostly on my Android. I set up Obsidian + Syncthing on my Macbook as I was doing some other work on it with my music library so I then copied the source code from Obsidian into Github. Loving this setup so far. 

### Things I Made This Week

### Links 

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them. So many links this week!! Some of them came from <a href="https://notes.jeddacp.com" class="nametag">Jedda</a>, in case some seem familiar. 

- [Netigen: Dissonance in the Dark](https://netigen.com/read/dissonance-in-the-dark) - Courtney has an amazing way with words. This one was a great stream of consciousness piece. 
- [Non-Negotiable Self-Care: The Art of Being "Busy" for Yourself | prickly oxhe.art](https://prickly.oxhe.art/non-negotiable-self-care/) - A good read, but I always hate using CEOs as an example for carving out time. A lot of the time the story seems apocryphal more than anything else, and even though CEOs have a lot to do, often they have more freedom to protect their time than people lower down the ladder. Nevertheless, this is a great post that highlights the importance of making time for yourself.
