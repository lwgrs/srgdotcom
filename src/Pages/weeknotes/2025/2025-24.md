### Things this week 
My Lihit Lab pencil case arrived Monday, so I was able to start my new method of carrying my bullet journal - no folio, just the notebook and the pencil case. So far (a week into it) I love it. It's nice also to have multiple pens and pencils (well...just *one* pencil) at my disposal. This was a good purchase.

Also this week I looked into my mobile phone plans and made a small change that drastically increased my data (how much I get, and the speed) and was also *cheaper* than the current plans. I've been using older plans and just never looked into it. I should have done it sooner! 

My wife and I were tourists this weekend and went on a boat tour on the Rideau Canal - I'll write something about that later I think. 

And speaking of new things earlier, I found a new backback to replace my old one that was falling apart along with a new pair of sandals from the same brand that I have been getting for the past several years. Both of them were blue! What fun. I plan on getting another pair of sandals next week - a black pair. I find that replacing these shoes every 2 years or so gives them some good life. I eventually grind the soles down to flat nothingness after probably a year, so stretching them to 2 years seems like a lot as it is. 
### Health Notes
At the start of the week I started an experiment: wearing a stainless steel ring on my right hand as a test to see if I have some sort of metal allergy. For a long time now I've had this dry area on my left ring finger (where I wear my wedding ring) and it just won't go away. We are wondering if I've developped a metal or gold allergy. One of my nieces is allergic to gold, so it's possible. Just strange that it's only showing up now. Anyway my finger was fine all week, so the next test is to clean the inside of my wedding ring and wear it on my right hand, see what happens. 

Unfortunately the week was not great for my back. The pain that started last weekend just didn't go away, fluctuating on the pain scale anywhere from 3-5 depending on the day. It was back down to a 3 at the end of the week though, and that's where I'm at today. I hope it goes away soon. On the plus side I was able to play softball on Tuesday, though running was a little difficult. I probably would have taken a pinch runner later in the game - tonight (Monday) is a double-header so that's still a possibility. 

Beyond that - I had blood work done to test my medication levels and they came back virtually the same as last year. I'll have to follow up with my neurologist. 
### Tech & Blog Stuff 
- Added [Subscribe Openly](https://subscribeopenly.net/) RSS links to all of my sites.
- trying out shared bookmarks folder for weekly links. Seeing how it goes (details below).
### Media 
- Unsubscribed from [Writing Excuses podcast](https://writingexcuses.com). Just not getting the same thing from them anymore. Other than Howard I don't relate well to the hosts. 
- Found out about [a new Bowling For Soup album](https://app.crucialtracks.org/profile/srg/20250612) and I really like it.
- Started listening to CBC Radio 3 podcast again, starting with Episode 2 from June 2005(!). Will try to listen by matching week. I'm a week ahead, so I have time to download and "prep" for upcoming weeks.
- saw *How to Train Your Dragon* Friday - faithful adaptation of the animated original. The live action and VFX meshed together very well. Solid movie experience, especially if you haven't seen the original.
### Links 
I created [Shared Links on Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/srgower/shared-links-56296964) - apparently you can follow an RSS feed for it? I think in order to keep it manageable I'm going to clear it out every now and then; I like <a href="https://jeddacp.com" class="nametag">Jedda's</a> "postroll" method. 

But for now here's what I added this week. 

- [Rewatch: The Fantastic Four – MacManX.com](https://macmanx.com/2020/08/10/rewatch-the-fantastic-four/)
- [Focus on the small things, a journaling exercise | Sylvia's Studio](https://sylvia.studio/focus-on-the-small-things-a-journaling-exercise/) Reminds me of the [5-4-3-2-1 method](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/behavioral-health-partners/bhp-blog/april-2018/5-4-3-2-1-coping-technique-for-anxiety).[Everyone says they want opinionated design until they get it](https://birchtree.me/blog/everyone-says-they-want-opinionated-design-until-they-get-it/) - Agree with this post. I see it every time Samsung releases a OneUI update. Contrast issues abound there too.
