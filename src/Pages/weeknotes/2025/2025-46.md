### Things this week 
I started the week with a vacation day that was spent running around getting winter tires put on our vehicles. Naturally we did this the day *after* a major snowstorm; however we had these appointments scheduled in advance so there was no waiting around in long lineups. 

I also had the house to myself for the week while my wife was away for work. That meant a lot of video games and a lot of movies. After going to bed past 1am Monday evening (technically, Tuesday morning) I needed to be more structured with my free time. I did pretty well, and I wrote about all of it. 

Overall it was a good week and I'm starting week 47 with another day off. 
### Health Notes
- Got an X-ray of my foot, and was able to download a copy of the photos. I now have an X-ray of both my feet. 
### Media 
- A week for movies. This week alone, I watched: 
	- *[Bram Stoker's Dracula](https://boxd.it/bFZCRL)* (1992, dir. Francis Ford Coppola)
	- *[Sneakers](https://boxd.it/bHdE0B)* (1992, dir. Phil Alden Robinson)
	- *[Now You See Me: Now You Don't](https://boxd.it/bJfV6t)* (2025, dir. Ruben Fleischer)
- I enjoyed all of them; *Sneakers* was the only one rated 5 stars
- Bought a digital copy of *Star Wars Racer Revenge* (PS2) - I owned this back when I had a PS2. Fun game. I think it holds up
