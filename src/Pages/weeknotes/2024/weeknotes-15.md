### Things I made:

- [FW: Misconceptions about Firefox's Privacy Preserving Ad Measurement](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/firefox-privacy-misconception/)
- [Mid-Book Review of "The Plot" by Jean Hanff Korelitz](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/mid-book-plot/)
- [Re: Thinking Out Loud About My Photos Overload](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/re-thinking-out-loud-about-my-photos-overload/)
- [Jays From Home # 134 - Looking for the Positives (with my brother Matt)](https://jays-from-home.pinecast.co/episode/b3cb7832/looking-for-the-positives)

### Personal

- Well that was a fun Friday. There was a massive global IT outage caused by a faulty update from Crowdstrike. Why is it always July, on a Friday? Either way, memes were on point.
- Prompted by [this post from Jedda](https://notes.jeddacp.com/thinking-out-loud-about-my-photos-overload/), I grabbed a spare SSD and moved my photos to an external drive. I also uploaded them to OneDrive. Going forward I'm going to make sure I have my photos in two places and upload them right away. This SSD I'm using is less than 500GB though, and it's actually an internal hard drive, so I will need to get a larger HD and transfer them over again. 
- We bought two tire racks that were on sale from $80 down to $50; we are storing our winter tires in our storage unit because we get our tires changed over at a place that doesn't store tires for us. So we needed some racks to better organize things. It was a pain to put together but got it done. 

### Softball &#129358;

- Monday: Rainout!
- Tuesday: Win! 3-for-5 with 2 x 2B, 3 runs &#10032;
- Wednesday: Win! 3-for-3 with 1 x 3B, 1 RBI &#10032;&#10032;
- Season stats: GP: ## | Slug Line[^1]: .667/.681/1.586 | 4 Home Runs 
- &#10032; One of my doubles was complete luck; we had reached our maximum number of home runs, which means the next one would have been an out. I absolutely *crushed* the ball and I was sure it was going over the fence. Instead if hit the top of the fence and stayed inside the field. 
- &#10032;&#10032; This was probably my best game of the season. Unlike the previous night my triple was *not* luck, I hit it deep opposite field (RF for me) and just kept running hard. 
- Overall this was one of the better weeks of softball I've had in a while! 

### Healthy Living

- Holy moly I was so sore Friday after our PT session at the gym Thursday night. I guess that's a sign of a good workout. 
- I've been neglecting my private health journalling. I guess it's just not top-of-mind because it's, well, private. The good news is that I'm staying on top of everything and I don't need the journal to keep me "honest". 

### Media

- We finished *The Acolyte* and I was a little disappointed. I feel that it didn't deliver on what was promised, except when it comes to fight sequences. I think this show gave us the best choreographed lightsaber battles in Star Wars, ever. 
- Finally watched *American Fiction*. I really enjoyed it, but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting! And the ending - well I'll just say I'm not entirely sure about it right now. Either way, while being a definite satire it was also a great family drama.
- I recorded an hour-long radio special from [CHEZ 106](https://www.chez106.com) - "60 Minutes of Chris Cornell" on what would have been his 60th (Saturday July 20). Great group of songs, I enjoyed it. Going to tape over the top of the tape to prevent re-recording. Maybe some day I'll print a custom J-Card.
