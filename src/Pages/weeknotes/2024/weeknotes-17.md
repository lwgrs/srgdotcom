### Things I made:

- [Saturday Evening at Dow's Lake (photo post)](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/saturday-dows-lake/)
- [Blogs as Creative Nonfiction](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/blogs-as-creative-nonfiction/) 
- [Wednesday Thoughts: Writing About Epilepsy](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/wed-thoughts-epilepsy/)

### Personal

- I had someone reach out to me by email after they read my Wednesday thoughts :) It was nice to hear from someone I haven't talked to before. They asked for some more posts about weight loss - I'm still hesitant about that but will probably write something later this month focusing more on the tools and methods I'm using rather than raw data. 
- Spent the weekend up north with my wife's family. We come up here often, but there's usually a different experience every time. The highlight this time was fishing. We came home with 9 fish! And a lot of photos! I'll be posting them soon.
- I [decided I would stay off social media this weekend](https://ottawa.place/@srgower/112894172405904636), on top of my usual No Socials Sunday. I did a great job, in my opinion. I'm writing this on Monday and I still haven't been online.

### Softball &#129358;

- Monday: Loss; 2-for-3, 1 walk &#10032;
- Tuesday: Win; 1-for-4
- Wednesday: Loss; 0-for-3
- Season stats: GP: ## | Slug Line[^1]: .634/.651/1.513 | 4 Home Runs 
- &#10032; I played an inning at short stop and did really well. I made an excellent play to get an out at first base, and made an amazing backhanded catch on a ball that otherwise would have skipped through to the outfield. Unfortunately for that play, my first baseman was way off the bag and didn't get back in time to make the play for an out. 

### Healthy Living

- No bike rides this week. I wanted to ride into work, but not only was it too hot, but I didn't get enough sleep so was dragging myself out of bed. 
- On August 1st I started my new month micro-goal - keeping at or under my daily calorie budget. Already missed August 1st, but hoping to do better. It's not a kind of goal that is "pass or fail", but having a daily checkmark is (I hope) aspirational and will help me strive to meet the goal. I'm not going to feel disappointed if I don't make it one day or another. The idea is - if I'm not, figure out why and adjust. 
- I pulled something in my back on the weekend and woke up to nearly debilitating back pain (though nowhere near as bad as a few years back when I couldn't even get off the couch). I'm better now, but man...this is an ongoing issue. I get no warning of when my back might hurt, so it's not like I know what movements to avoid so I don't hurt myself. The silver lining is unless I *really* hurt it, it doesn't last more than a day or so.

### Media

- I was recently turned on to the podcast Going Rogue ([Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/going-rogue/id1636196453), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/2ktZYfjxF5PwG44UC0HPvK)) hosted by Tansy Gardam. I found it after reading the [most recent newsletter from Decoding Everything](https://www.decodingeverything.com/p/what-went-wrong-with-zack-snyders-rebel-moon). The first series covers the production of the movie *Rogue One* but goes on to cover other movies with long and often troubled productions. 
- I started watching the 90s X-Men season 3 "Phoenix Saga", and only 2 episodes in. I remarked that it was amusing how casually the X-Men were able to hijack a shuttle and just fly into space like it's nothing. Additionally - does Beast wear a "Howard the Duck" t-shirt in the second episode?
