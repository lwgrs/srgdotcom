*Week of April 23-29, 2024*

#### Personal 
- Whereas last week I did a lot of tidying up, I kind of undid some of that when trying to set up my Nintendo 64 (see the Media notes below). I need to tidy that up again - a project for the weekend. 
- Speaking of tidying though, my wife and I did some minor housecleaning and finally swapped our winter shoes for summer shoes. Yay sandals!
- I picked up some new clothes this weekend: a pair of comfy green pants, and some comfy shorts from Old Navy; and a couple of plain t-shirts from Wal-Mart. Nothing special about them, it just feels good to find clothes you like.

#### Healthy Living 
- Probably best to label this *unhealthy* living this week - I contracted a cold in the middle of the week. Started with a sore throat for a day and a half, then progressed to congestion. Seems to be getting better as of today. 
- I'm feeling the results of personal training. No soreness/stiffness after softball practice, and in general I feel more flexible and a better range of motion.
- As of today (April 30) I have flossed every night of April. That was my one small goal for the month and I must say I'm smashing it.

#### Media 
- I got a haul of video games this week. First was a PS3 copy of Need For Speed Hot Pursuit; I had a small cache of USD in my Paypal account that I was able to use to buy on eBay. 
    - Then I found a copy of Mario Tennis for the N64, followed by NHL 99 - both games I've been looking for for a while. And then [I had an embarrassingly hard time connecting the N64 to my TV](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/new-tech-stupid/)
