### Things I made:

- [Big Nope](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/big-nope/)
- [Looking Back on June 2024](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/looking-back-on-june-2024/)
- [Re: To Blogroll, or to not?](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/re-blogroll-or-not/)
- [Re-thinking my Blogroll Position](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/blogroll-position/)
- [Jays From Home #133 - "Holding Pattern"](https://jays-from-home.pinecast.co/episode/500d19ea/holding-pattern)[^1]

### Personal

- [Robert Birming](https://birming.com) replied to an older post of mine for his <mark>JulyReply</mark>. Read it here: https://birming.com/not-everything-sale/ 
- Nerdy blog stuff: made some updates to my "Now" page, and to the overall CSS themes. You may notice some arrows on links - these are links to websites not a part of **srgower.com**.

### Softball &#129358;

- Tuesday: Win! 2-for-4
- Wednesday: Loss; 2-for-4 - 1 double, 1 RBI 
- Season stats: GP: 19 | Slug Line[^2]: .621/.639/1.503 | 4 Home Runs 
- I had my best hit of the last couple of weeks on Wednesday (the double). It's also my first double since June 4th.

### Healthy Living

- Got my bike out for a ride to work. Unfortunately both tires were flat, so it needs a look-see by the repair shop. **However** I rode my wife's bike to work (even though it doesn't have functioning front brakes...woops!). 
 - The bike was fixed - the valve for the tube was crooked (probably my fault). The repair place replaced the tubes and I'm up and running again. 

### Media

- I'm a little frustrated with *The Acolyte*; I think it's a show that should have been released all at once instead of weekly. It has a lot of pacing issues and probably also stretched out too much. 
- Started reading *The Plot* by Jean Hanff Korelitz *(2021)*. I'm giving it a go for a bit but the narrator is insufferable in this story. I may mark the book as "DNF".
