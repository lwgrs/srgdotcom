### Things I made:

- [Mastodon FOMO](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/mastodon-fomo/)
- [Review: The Plot by Jean Hanff Korelitz - Full Spoilers!](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/review-the-plot/) 
- [A Dog Without a Care (photo post)](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/a-dog-without-a-care/)
- [Sunday Routine](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/sunday-routine/)

### Personal

- I didn't list these as things I made, because I didn't make them this week; but I reposted several of my old Wordpress blog posts on my [Bear blog](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev). They date back to 2020. I haven't imported all of them, I'm being selective; but will probably post some more. 
- [Veronique](https://veronique.ink) bought me my very first coffee!! I helped her out with some small CSS stuff but I think she was buying for my overall helpfulness with figuring out blog stuff. I hope that she is able to figure out what she wants to do with her blog (both with hosting and blog vs. email)! 
  - If you also want to buy me a coffee, you can [do that here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/srgower) <img class="icon" src="/icons/buymeacoffee.svg" alt="Buy Me A Coffee"/> 

### Softball &#129358;

- Monday: Loss; 3-for-3, 2 x 2B
- Tuesday: Win; 2-for-4, Ground Rule Double
- Wednesday: Rainout! 
- Season stats: GP: 26 | Slug Line[^1]: .670/.684/1.607 | 4 Home Runs 

### Healthy Living

- I went on two hour+ long bike rides on the weekend! It was beautiful weather and I've been wanting to get out on the bike for a while. I haven't been able to ride to work for various reasons, so these more than made up for it. I took some pictures along the way, which I will eventually share (I need to sort through them). 
  - My favourite ride was Saturday. It was a much cooler temperature outside and I got to cross two bridges over water between provinces. I think there were more hills but this was worth it. 
- Trying to put some context to my health watch numbers (steps, sleep). The struggle is that I need to keep up with it or else I'll drop it again. 

### Media

- I finished *The Plot* - you can read my review, linked above. 
- A weird thing I never noticed about *MLB The Show 16*: if a player's visual design has them wearing sunglasses, they still wear them at night. Their walk-up music should be changed to Corey Hart's "Sunglasses At Night". 
- More music this past weekend! And I am more than glad that my tape deck is working out so well. I listened to another recording I did Sunday night from the radio - it sounded really good. Also threw on 5 CDs and listened to them from disc 1 to disc 5, in order.
  - I recently found out that with [Open Scrobbler](https://openscrobbler.com) you can scribble entire albums at a time. Up until now I've been typing one song at a time. This is so much easier!
- I bought a neat little zine from [Trish Coxe](https://trishcoxe.world). I don't think Trish has a store set up for her zines yet, but you can click around her site to find links to buy her art. Anyway. The zine. It's a sort of "read-along" to a song. It's short, I believe 5 panels? It folds up to slightly smaller than a CD booklet, which is clever for being a read-along to a song. I liked it! 
- Weekend movies: *Kill Bill: Vol 2* and *The Bourne Identity*. Interesting contrast in types of action in each film. The fighting sound effects were similar in both films, but felt way out of place in *Bourne*.
