*Week of April 16-22, 2024*

#### Personal 
- Another weekend ending with my wife going on a business trip. A longer one this time - she was gone Friday afternoon to Sunday afternoon. She had a really good trip and an enjoyable conference, so that's good! On my end I [made some updates to the website](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/website-updates/)[^1]
- I watched the late Blue Jays games (they were in San Diego) - usually I don't watch late games because I don't want to stay up. But not going anywhere the next day and being on my own...makes for something to do
- More video games: I played a couple MLB The Show 16 games; I have a "bottom feeders" playoff bracket set up with all the bad teams that finished at the bottom of the league in 2016. I won 1 game, lost the other. 
  - I also set up a NEW Be a GM mode in NHL Legacy; as I said last week I made a team TOO terrible and wasn't getting much out of it. I created a new     BAGM controlling the Edmonton Oilers. We'll see how that goes. 
- I wrote two blog posts but spent a lot of time posting on [Mastodon](https://mstdn.ca/@srgower/); I especially liked my [post titled "Habits"](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/habits/) because it's part of the writing I'm trying to do where I write more about memories of the past. 
- Monday (yesterday) I set up a [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) profile & task to set a random daily wallpaper from a folder on my phone. I have a hard time picking a wallpaper I want to stick to so this will help with that. I'll probably write a post about that later.

#### Healthy Living 

- I don't know if most people would qualify this as part of "healthy living" but this is my page, so I am. Last week I mentiond listening to a "life hacks" episode of Ologies, well this week I listened to one about [decluttering](https://www.alieward.com/ologies/oikologyencore). I've been taking in a lot of the information in these episodes and applying them in different ways. 
  - As with things from *Stolen Focus* I am starting to use Google Keep to record things I want to look up - and save them for later instead of looking     them up right away. The next step here is perhaps including context as to *why* I want to look it up. 
  - I tidied up a shelf full of tools and extra screws. In the process I got rid of a bunch of rolls of tape we have no use for. And I found some lost     tools! 
-  Still experimenting with KT Tape; I've found what works for my toe/metatarsal. And I also confirmed that it still hurts when I don't have it stabalized with tape, so my upcoming doctor visit is still relevant. 
- I cleaned out my car! It was looking pretty dirty from its last long-range trip and it was a nice day Sunday, so I finally got to wiping it down and vacuuming.

#### Media 

- I read this article: [How Platforms Killed Pitchfork](https://www.platformer.news/why-pitchfork-died/); kind of a sad mini history about Pitchfork but also prompted me to do more listening to my Spotify Discover Weekly + Release Radar playlists 
- Watched more *X-Files* - I really enjoyed "Beyond The Sea" and I think it's the strongest of season 1, so far 
- Caught up with the latest season of *Star Trek Discovery*. We watched the first 3 episodes. I like it so far but it's very much following a similar format to the last 3 seasons. 

[^1]: I figured out the mobile view so it stops the horizontal scroll. But my long "What am I doing now?" link looks ugly on mobile...will probably just change it to say "Now".
