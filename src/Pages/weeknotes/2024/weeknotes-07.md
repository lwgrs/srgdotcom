### Things I made:

- [Trying "Vanilla Freddo Cappuccino"](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/trying-vanilla-freddo-cappuccino/) (here's a [picture of said coffee](https://mstdn.ca/@srgower/112495955832272107))
- [In Which My Dog Fell Off a Boat](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/dog-overboard/)
- [Pulling from the Stack(Edit)](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/stackedit/)
- [Jays From Home #130 - L3, 4-6](https://jays-from-home.pinecast.co/episode/f4b35ec3/l3-4-6)
- [Productivity Traps](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/productivity-traps/)

### Personal

- I thought I'd move my softball results to its own heading.
- I'm getting tired with Simplenote - I love the app and all, but the captchca requirements every time I log in to the web app really irritates me. I'm trying to find something similar but most notes apps automatically convert markdown to WYSIWYG editing which I don't want.
    - Notesnook seems to be able to export your notes to markdown, but I'm unclear if that's a Pro feature or not
    - Trying out Notion's editor as well; it seems a little more straightforward for exporting as markdown.
    - SimpleNote still winning out for simplicity + easier to edit in plain text with an *option* to preview
    - I remembered [Stack Edit](https://stackedit.io/). It's browser-only but is not giving me grief with captchcas.[^1]
        - Also, I have a bunch of things written in here I forgot about.
- Never mind the above. I gave up on apps and web based stuff...I'm doing all of this with text files and OneDrive. It's better that way.
- Re-installed the [Daylio app](https://daylio.net/)) - I want something for tracking my [monthly goals](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/mini-goals/))
    - I started building a habit tracker in Notion and then remembered there are apps that do the hard work of setting this up much better than starting from scratch

### Professional

- I celebrated 18 years with my organization on the 22nd. Crazy to think that I've been there almost 20 years. The longest I've been with one company before that was 5 years, and that was a McDonald's.
- Employee tech issues are stressful. My team constantly needs help, and I do my best, but it can be taxing on the mental health.

### Softball

- Only got one game in this week. Hit 2-for-3 with a walk. 2 RBIs[^2] as well

### Healthy Living

- My foot is feeling so much better. I went out for two long-ish walks at lunch at work this week. I've been holding off for the last few weeks to try to rest my foot a little.
    - Of course I undid some progress by spending all day outdoors on uneven ground Saturday, wearing *sandals*.

### Media

- My wife and I moved on to season 6 of *The Crown* (Netflix)
    - I found seasons 4 and 5 to be disappointing. It feels like after the first 3 seasons the producers/writers got bored and wanted to skip to the salacious material (i.e. Charles & Diana). Several things were touched on in one episode and then completely ignored. Phillip's father was killed when his boat was blown up - but no follow-up to the IRA after that?
- Fell down a rabbit hole and watched a YouTube video [analyzing how realistic the law is portrayed in Liar Liar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNnDvdtj9Us)
- A cool [explainer of decaf coffee](https://youtu.be/yYTSdlOdkn0?si=6d6ABA8EyQt0y8cV)
