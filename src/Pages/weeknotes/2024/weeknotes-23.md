### Things I made:

- [Testing The Cheap Lens](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/testing-the-cheap-lens/) 
- [Tuesday Thoughts 03](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/tues-thoughts-03/) 
- [Review: Healing Back Pain (Dr. John E. Sarno)](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/healing-back-pain/) 
- [An idea for a newsletter](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/an-idea-for-a-newsletter/) 
- [Jays From Home # 137 - Bowden Francis is One-Hittable](https://jays-from-home.pinecast.co/episode/f135e5f8/bowden-francis-is-one-hittable) *(recorded with my brother)* 


### Personal

- My brother said that it's becoming more difficult to work around his sons' (my nephews) schedules on weekends, and doesn't have time for [our podcast](https://pinecast.co/jays-from-home/) anymore. So, something to figure out going forward. 
  - We recorded our last podcast yesterday (link above). We left the door open for the future but I think I'm going to let that podcast end and not take it on solo. I also wrote about some ideas I have for a [possible newsletter in the future](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/an-idea-for-a-newsletter/).
- Along with my bad back pain (see health notes) I broke my glasses on Sunday. I glued them back together but - at the time of writing I'm unsure if they're stable enough to continue wearing in the short term. It wouldn't be such a bad thing, except that I'm not at home and only have two pairs of contact lenses (and I'm wearing one of them right now). I hope that a local optician shop has some trial pairs available or something. 

### Healthy Living

- I've been getting away from tracking and writing about my progress for the last several weeks. My last update was a week ago (as I write this) and there's not much substance / reflection to them. That said, I haven't been backsliding as I might expect by not being on top of things. But I feel like I need to get back into a more mindful state before things start to go sideways. 
- I had some really bad back pain that led to a hospital stay. Thankfully, muscle spasms only. 
  - This morning, and since Saturday evening, I've been pain-free. I bought some stronger OTC muscle relaxants to have on hand if it flares up again.

### Links 

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them.

- [Copy Markdown URL Bookmarklet | Otávio’s blog](https://otavio.cc/copy-markdown-url-bookmarklet/) 
- [Star Wars film newly dubbed in Ojibway will give 'boost' to the language, its Darth Vader actor says | CBC Radio](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/ojibway-star-wars-darth-vader-1.7322979)
- [Details emerge about accused, buyer in Churchill portrait heist | CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/winston-churchill-portrait-stolen-buyer-suspect-1.7321364) 

### Media

- Last week I borrowed [Healing Back Pain: The Mind-Body Connection](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f167ab03-ae71-4ab3-bbc6-0a09c6a68c87) by Dr. John E. Sarno from the library, based on a [reccomendation from Brandon](https://brandons-journal.com/post/dr-sarno-and-back-pain/). I went into the book skeptical, and I still am a little bit (Dr. Sarno attributes a LOT of physical pain to mental/emotional triggers and presents anecdotal evidence as "proof" that he's right); but it's definitely an interesting read. 
- *[Prisoners](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/146233-prisoners)*, 2013. I've had this movie on my list for quite a while and finally watched it on DVD; I thought it was great, **5 stars**. I especially loved the cinematography, the way that the scenes looked naturally lit by the ambient lighting around them. The weather was done very well, especially the snow. 
- Finished *[Batman: Caped Crusader](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/125909-batman-caped-crusader)*. The season is a bit uneven but I like some of the stylistic choices they made with this one.
