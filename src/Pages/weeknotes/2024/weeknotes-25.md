### Things I made:

- [Re: Audio Content: How Much Is Too Much?](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/audio-content/) 
- [Random Colour Contrasts](https://contrasts.srgower.com) 
- [Contrasts, Linux, and Plain HTML](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/contrasts-html/)

### Personal

- I linked to a new site I created, hand-coded in plain HTML: https://contrasts.srgower.com. I wanted a place to catalogue the various combinations the [Random Color Contrasts bot](https://botsin.space/@randomColorContrasts) generates. It still needs some work with the CSS but I'm holding off making any further changes to that stuff until I've finished entering all my current saved combinations. 
- This week's week notes are...a little fuzzy. I was in Calgary with my wife Thursday to Sunday evening and whenever you travel, things kind of fall apart. I don't know what day it is today. Wednesday, maybe? 

### Nerdy Blog Stuff

- Robert Birming continues to do cool stuff with his Bear theming. I didn't use this in the way that he implemented it but I found out about this 'share' service through his [share buttons](https://birming.com/bear-share-buttons/) post.

### Links 

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them.

- [Linkfest #24: Secret Cars, New Euripides, and "The Torino Impact Hazard Scale" • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/clivethompson/archive/linkfest-24-secret-cars-new-euripides-and-the/) 
- [Think your dog can understand words? This scientist says you might be right | CBC Radio](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/dogs-understanding-words-new-research-1.7326495)

### Media

- Heard a new track from [Our Lady Peace](https://www.ourladypeace.com/) called "Sound The Alarm". I liked it okay I guess, better than what they released on *Spiritual Machines II* (I wanted to like that album more than I did). It definitely sounds like their late work, which I'm mixed on. Incidentally I heard it while listening to [Indie88](https://indie88.com/) via [James Harris'](https://mstdn.ca/@jbwharris/) project, [scrobblerad.io](https://scrobblerad.io). 
- Finally watched *Arrival* (Denis Villeneuve, 2016). Visually it is a stunning movie, and the plot moves along at a near-perfect pace. The movie reminded me a lot of the visuals in *Dune*. Everything in the movie felt *real* as well, in the sense that the spaceships looked like they were physical objects occupying space in the world. They weren't just CG creations. The score was great, as well. Highly recommend.
- Re-listened to [The Strumbellas'](https://www.discogs.com/artist/3705444-The-Strumbellas) 2013 album, *[We Still Move on Dance Floors](https://www.discogs.com/master/928622-The-Strumbellas-We-Still-Move-On-Dance-Floors)*. I remember I first heard their music while shopping in...I can't remember the shop to be honest. I think it was a sports store in a small town. Either way I still really like the album, I recommend it. Their album *Hope* is probably the most popular with "Spirits" hitting Top 40 radio here in Canada but I like *Dance Floors* a lot. The album art was my phone wallpaper for a while. 
- I started watching two new TV shows: "Slow Horses" (Apple TV+) and "The Good Place" (Netflix). The latter I started a while back but never really got into it, so when I re-watched the first two episodes again I forgot quite a lot of what I watched before. It's a fun show! Slow Horses - I really liked the first episode. Trying to find time to get my wife to watch the next one with me to see if she'll enjoy it with me so I don't have to carve out time to watch it, we can just throw it on.
