### Personal

- I broke my walkman last week. I was adjusting the playback speed and ended up breaking the screw (more accurately, the adjustable resistor) that handles this process. Now it plays at chipmunk speed. It's fixable, I just need to source a replacement part & take it to an electronics repair shop. If only I knew how to solder...
- OK, social media sites. I think I've mostly figured out what I'm doing with each place. [Mastodon](https://ottawa.place/@srgower) - this is where I have meaningful discussions with people. [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@srgower) - this is where the joke posts from twitter went. Fun for a break to read. [Bluesky↗](https://bsky.app/profile/srgower.com) - I haven't nailed this one down yet. Trying to increase my usage. But seems like a mix between Mastodon and Threads, and probably where I'll go for sports talk (Blue Jays & Sens). 
- More cassette deck stuff. I think I have a speed calibration issue on my new deck; I'd like to fix it but probably won't get around to it for a little bit. I'd like to have a proper speed calibration tape but won't be able to get one for this weekend, and I won't really have another chance to work on it for a little while. So I'll just deal with the state it's in.

### Softball &#129358;

- Monday: Win! 4-for-4, 4 RBI &#10032;
- Tuesday: A double header! Game 1 (loss): 1-for-2, BB, 1 RBI | Game 2 (loss): 4-for-4, 3 runs, 1 RBI
- Wednesday: Rainout
- Season stats: GP: 22 | Slug Line[^1]: .658/.675/1.543 | 4 Home Runs 
- &#10032; I didn't have much to do in the outfield, and I didn't have outstanding hits, but I was consistent and came up with a big hit in the bottom of the 6th which helped us get an extra run on top of the visiting team so that we had more breathing room to win the game. Also, ultimately, we were all the big losers as the mosquitos feasted on us the entire night.

### Healthy Living

- I went out for a really nice bike ride - just over an hour (including breaks for a lot of photos). I mainly went out to have a look at a new pedestrian/cycling bridge that was installed recently. 
- I've been sticking to my daily logging - so far this month I've hit every day of the week, logging 100%. Many days I've gone over my limit but I'm making sure I don't beat myself up about that. 

### Media

- Going through my CD crates, I listened to some more of a recent rip session. First was Joel Plaskett Emergency's *[Ashtray Rock](https://joelplaskett.com/products/ashtray-rock-cd)*, and then I turned to *[Castles](https://www.discogs.com/master/2935009-The-Philosopher-Kings-Castles)* by The Philosopher Kings. I don't remember why I bought the latter, but it was in the crate so I listened. Not a bad pop-rock type album, good easy listening in the background while I worked. Nothing spectacular though. 
  - I liked the song "Beautiful Creature". 
- Enjoying https://soma.fm - specifically the 80s Underground channel. As a result I also globbed onto SiriusXM's 1st Wave channel. 
- Spent the weekend listening to tapes: *[Foo Fighters](https://www.discogs.com/master/62100-Foo-Fighters-Foo-Fighters)*, Taylor Swift's *[Midnights](https://www.discogs.com/master/2831825-Taylor-Swift-Midnights)*. And CDs: The Sheep Dogs *[Learn & Burn](https://www.discogs.com/release/3661054-The-Sheepdogs-Learn-Burn)*, Jet *[Get Born](https://www.discogs.com/release/984322-Jet-Get-Born)*, Kaiser Chiefs *[Employment](https://www.discogs.com/release/6453942-Kaiser-Chiefs-Employment)*, Tokyo Police Club *[Elephant Shell](https://www.discogs.com/release/6453942-Kaiser-Chiefs-Employment)*, Stabilo *[Flawed Design](https://www.discogs.com/release/6287099-Stabilo-Happiness-Disaster)* 
- Watched a couple of movies on the weekend too! I wrote about *[Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood](https://letterboxd.com/stephen_g/film/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood/)* and a re-watch of *[Kill Bill: Vol 1](https://letterboxd.com/stephen_g/film/kill-bill-vol-1/)
