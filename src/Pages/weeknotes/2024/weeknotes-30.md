I'm trying a slightly different format for my weeknotes. Kind of related to one of the links I'm sharing further down. 

### Things this week

- I bought a farraday box for our car key fobs. Happy to report that it works great! I tested it out in the car with the keys in the box - and the car wouldn't start. 
- The DS9 model kit my friend got me at Christmas is coming along nicely! All the pieces are put together, and I just bought some paint on Saturday. So two more steps until I'm done: painting, then decals. I really *should* have followed the suggestion on the box, to complete pieces in separate stages and paint/apply decals before attaching it all together. But I couldn't help myself. 
- **Happy thing**: the sound my dog makes as she trots through the fallen leaves in Autumn.
- I [baked muffins](https://ottawa.place/@srgower/113421468126690873) and they turned out *excellent*. We had frozen blueberries from my father-in-law who picked them last summer, and they're still mighty tasty. 

### Things I made this week

- [The Monster in Your Mind | Photos by Stephen Gower](https://photos.srgower.com/2024/the-monster-in-your-mind/)
- [I shouldn't design a transit system, ever](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/i-shouldnt-design-a-transit-system-ever/) 
- [Suspense Files and Building Habits](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/suspense-files-and-building-habits/) 
- [Wednesday Thoughts 03](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/wednesday-03/)

### Tech & Blog Stuff

- I tried Darktable (very briefly) - I think it's too barebones for me compared to Lightroom. I can see how it would work faster than Lightroom does on my computer, but I couldn't quite figure out the interface. I didn't give it a good chance, granted, but first impressions are pretty important. 
- Added a `nametag` class to my stylesheet (see below). I want to use it to emulate when you tag somebody in Discord or Teams etc. 
  - Of course if you're reading in a feed reader you won't see it.

### Media

- I'm really enjoying the Stingray Radio channel ["Decades of Alt Rock"](https://music.stingray.com/en/channels/VIB_N0421/decades-of-alt-rock). It seems to have a lot of contemporary alt music (as I type this, Foster the People's "Lost in Space" is playing) but also some 2000s indie. It's a corporate streaming service but it's good. I also recommend the Live 88.5 "The Café" channel[^1]. 
- Sunday I had the sudden idea to make 2025 the Year of Not Tracking (for books, at least). I currently track *everything* on [The Storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/srgower), and I have been setting reading goals for the last couple of years. I know I'm not going to hit my goal this year (20), and I don't really care - it's just an arbitrary number I picked. But I'm leaning toward not even tracking books next year. Don't know why...just a thought. 

### Links

This weeks links come exclusively from <a href="https://notes.jeddacp.com/" class="nametag">@Jedda</a>. She has a <a href="https://notes.jeddacp.com/postroll/">post roll</a> where she posts links to individual articles. Often these are articles I don't see on my own - so I'm glad that she does so. Every week in her weeknotes she "rolls off" a set of links so that's how I end up finding them. 

- [What is it about people who write Weeknotes? - Twelvety](https://www.twelvety.net/2024/10/what-is-it-about-people-who-write-weeknotes) 
- [Hunting Cryptids with Frame 352 (and a cheap thermal print camera) | quailblog](https://blog.curiousquail.com/hunting-cryptids-with-frame-352-and-a-cheap-thermal-print-camera/)
- [Frame 352 by hugeboar](https://maxwellander.itch.io/frame-352) - This is related to the above post; this looks like a really fun game to play. Sounds like something fun to do on a hike.
