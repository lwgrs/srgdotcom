### Things this week

-  The move to our new office building is official. While I've been going once a week for a while now, it's different with more people working in the building (including my own team). Definitely feeling the awkwardness of having any browser windows open. 
- In concordance with the [year without tracking](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/year-of-not-tracking/) I uninstalled [The Storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/) from my phone. I recognized that simply having it on my phone I am tempted to update it when I'm finished a reading session. I have been consciously holding back from opening the app after reading a chapter during lunch at work. 
- Went for a haircut, finally! I can't remember the last time I had one, but my hair was far too long and unruly. 
- The other night, I felt like I needed to do something with my hands - ended up taking out a Star Wars colouring book and completed a page. It was nice and relaxing. It was "purposeful mindlessness". 
- I think this is the last set of weeknotes I'm going to upload this year. I have two weeks of vacation coming up after this week, so I think I'm going to spend less time online - social media, posting, everything in general.
