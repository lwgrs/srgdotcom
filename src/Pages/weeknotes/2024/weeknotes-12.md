### Things I made:

- [#Junited2024](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/Junited-2024) finished up this week. 
- [Another Gaming Interlude](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/gaming-interlude/)
- [Creative Process](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/creative-process/)
- [Tech Alternatives and Privacy](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/tech-and-privacy/)

### Personal

- Now - this isn't something that I've created last week, but my brother did a couple of interviews with some authors. At around the [11:38 mark of our latest episode](https://pca.st/episode/422e3fba-1dad-4b63-b024-09ed0929cae2?t=698) author David Bockino ([Game On: How Sports Media Grew Up, Sold Out, and Got Personal with Billions of Fans](https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/nebraska/9781496233172) mentions how our podcast sounds professional and could be something distributed by ESPN or other media outlets. So nice to hear. Especially after my "Creative Process" post. 
- Along similar lines, someone reached out by email to respond to my post about tech & privacy! Someone I didn't already know. That's cool :)
- Happy Canada Day!

### Softball &#129358;

- Monday: Loss; 3-for-4, 1 RBI
- Tuesday: Ties; 3-for-5, 1 RBI 
- Wednesday: Win (walk-off!); 2-for-4
- Season stats: GP: 17 | Slug Line[^1]: .638/.656/1.553 | X Home Runs 
- I got to try a trapper glove on Tuesday playing first base, for the first time. It felt weird catching the ball - did not feel like I had it in my glove at all. 
- Overall a decent week on defense. Made some good catches. Offense wasn't very strong (yes I hit for a high average, but all singles and not hit very hard).

### Healthy Living

- &#129656; I donated blood on Monday! And then proceeded to roast in right field playing softball. 

### Media

- Finally started *Moon of the Turning Leaves*. It was a bit jarring to pick up the story 10 years after the first book but it makes sense. The chapters move along at the same brisk pace.

[^1]: Slug line is Average / On Base Percentage / Slugging Percentage
