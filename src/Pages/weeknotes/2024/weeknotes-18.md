### Personal

- I read [Jedda's post about the Camp Snap camera again](https://notes.jeddacp.com/campsnap-screen-free-toy-camera/) and it has me thinking about simple point-and-shoot photo adventures. While I love tinkering around with settings to get creative shots, I like the idea more and more of just taking the photo and going with the image I get - no auto processing from software algorithms, no post-processing. I suppose the middle ground (aside from buying a new camera) is to set the settings I want ahead of time and just taking the photo I get from those settings instead of fiddling to get the best shot. 
- I found a bunch of free Lightroom presets: https://www.lukeptaylor.com/blog/category/Presets - I'm not a huge fan of *all* of them, but I'm definitely going to play around with them. So far I've only tried them in Lightroom Mobile so I think I'll get a better feel for them on a big monitor. 
- I've been thinking about my ["Now"](/now/) page - prompted by a post from [Noisy Deadlines](https://noisydeadlines.net/deleting-my-now-page). I'm going to write something up about it this coming week, probably. 

### Softball &#129358;

- Tuesday: Win; 2-for-4, 1x2B, 2xR &#10032;
- Wednesday: A double-header! Game 1: Loss; 1-for-3 | Game 2: Loss; 2-for-2, 2xBB, 1xHR &#10032;&#10032;
- Sunday: Loss; 1-for-2, BB, 2xR &#10032;&#10032;&#10032;
- &#10032; I started this game with a sore back. My first at-bat ended up being a double - that was a hard run. I didn't care too much about the results off my bat, but still came away with a solid game. My best inning defensively was the top of the 1st, when I threw out a runner at first and at home.
- &#10032;&#10032; So you'd think I'm starring this for the home run (it is my first home run since May I think!), but the reason I'm starring this game is because of the single I hit: we played the same team for both games of the double header, and in pretty much all of my at-bats in the first game I was hitting opposite field (toward first base). Their pitcher kept saying to their 1st base player it was coming her way, and I could see they shifted all the way to the right. I sometimes get frustrated with this and tonight was one of those nights. I set myself up at the back of the batter's box and waited for a pitch that was closer to inside, and ripped a grounder between third and short. Perfection.
- &#10032;&#10032;&#10032; I played an inning at third base in this game, and made an amazing catch - the ball was lined to my left, and I ran over with my arm outstretched and made the catch. No one was expecting it.
- Season stats: GP: 33 | Slug Line[^1]: .625/.650/1.516 | 5 Home Runs 

### Healthy Living

- I was presented with my first "dilemma" of my new plan: to eat a DQ Blizzard or not? A bunch of free Blizzards were brought into the office on Wednesday, and I was debating whether I'd like the free treat or not. Turned out they were the "mini" sizes so I opted to fit it into my budget for the day. I pushed a snack I bought at lunchtime to the next day, so that was one less snack to buy! 
- I changed up some activity levels in Cronometer to get a more realistic TDEE number (outlined in the follow-up post to my weight loss colophon), which will hopefully translate to more accurate tracking numbers & better results. 

### Links 

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them. 

- [You can make your J cards using photo paper! : cassetteculture](https://www.reddit.com/r/cassetteculture/comments/1091que/you_can_make_your_j_cards_using_photo_paper/) 
- [On Sharing Photography | Another Lens](https://anotherlens.blog/post/on-sharing-photography) - Saw this on Jedda's [postroll](https://notes.jeddacp.com/postroll/) 
- [How a shipwreck from 1965 still haunts some Kagawong locals today | CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/kagawong-history-day-rhu-sudbury-residents-big-lakes-1.7289381) 

### Media

- Really enjoying *Moon of the Turning Leaves*. Rice writes tension *very* well and it feels like there's danger around every corner. 
- Watched *[3:10 to Yuma (2007, James Mangold)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/5176-3-10-to-yuma)*. Fantastic movie, great western overall and great action. This is now the 5th James Mangold movie I've seen overall (which is two more than I thought I had watched). 
- Then watched *[Children of Men (2006, Alfonso Cuarón)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/9693-children-of-men)*. This was only my second time seeing the film; the first was in 2006, in theatres. Why have I not re-watched this since then? It's a beautiful film. I'm glad that I did see it in theatres because even on a big screen TV at home, it's not the same at all. 
  - And I realized that I had an unintended theme: One character transporting another character to a mode of transportation (a train in *3:10*, a boat in *Children of Men*). 
- Started watching *[Batman: Caped Crusader](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/125909-batman-caped-crusader)*. I like it so far, especially the deliberate aesthetic. Makes me want to go back and watch Batman: The Animated Series too.
