### Things I made:

- [The Imaginary Things Holding You Back](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/imaginary-things/) 
- [Problematic People](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/problematic-people/) 
- [Kind Words](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/kind-words/) 

### Personal

- Still trying to get the hang of having a "free" Sunday after ending the podcast with my brother. There are things I want to do - record my own podcasts, build models, do puzzles, general tinkering...but I haven't started anything yet. I'm possibly putting imaginary pressure on my shoulders and that's what's holding me back.

### Healthy Living

- The cold symptoms subsided early in the week. My wife thinks I'm going to start suffering from "seasonal change" cold symptoms. I like that idea because it means I'm not actually sick. But maybe it's all in my head? Is that a thing? 
- As of writing (Tuesday Oct 8) my weight is trending back upward after several weeks of trending down. Definitely related to avoiding food logging for quite a few days between end of September and while I was away in Calgary. Back to it now, and while I'm going over my limit, the goal right now is to get back into the daily habit. Will be difficult for Thanksgiving. 
- We've had two sessions with our new personal trainer; so far it's been a good fit. Things are a little stiff but we only just met him and he's been put in a tough position (as are we). But we like the variety of exercises he has us doing and it's been different each time. 

### Tech 

- I've been playing around with different keyboard setups on my phone. I changed up some things with GBoard but then decided to try out Samsung's keyboard; people seem to like it in general so I thought I'd give it a shot. I set it up similarly to gboard (size and no number row) to give it a fair shake. I'm going to stick with it for another week or so. 
- I also installed Microsoft SwiftKey - but it's not going to work for me. I don't have access to Bitmoji through the keyboard; I'd have to switch to the "Bitmoji keyboard" to insert one every time so that's too much of a bother. Otherwise, it would be a strong contender. 

### Links 

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them.

- [I Finally Saw, and Used, an App Clip • Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/blog/i-finally-saw-and-used-an-app-clip/) 

### Media

- Finished *[The Star Web](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/93d3b35b-2e0d-46ea-978f-1083ba898be4)* by George Zebrowski. I gave it 1 star...it started out as an interesting piece with characters using real science to try to piece together what was going on, and then it stumbled into pure adventure sci-fi with giant bugs or something. Weird book, but I picked it up at random based on cover and synopsis. Wasn't expecting much. 
- Started reading *[Something Wicked This Way Comes](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c8041768-08e1-4855-9065-1105ae45c444)* by Ray Bradbury. I forgot I picked this up from a thrift shop a couple of months ago. Also didn't know this was a movie until I saw the book. Should be a good "spooky" read for October. 
- Read *[Whatever Happened to the Fantastic Four?](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/977e7ed0-9fd6-41ac-8f1d-708b15b8f541)* by Ryan North (and illustrators). It's a fun standalone comic with various twists that are fun to read through. There's another volume available but I haven't checked it out on Hoopla yet.
