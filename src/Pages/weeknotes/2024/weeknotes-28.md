### Things I made:

- [Thunderbird Beta for Android and other Tech Notes](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/thunderbird/)
- [Photo Dump - September-October 2024](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/photo-dump/)

### Personal

- I did some journalling Thursday night, and wrote about some personal writing things. I tried turning it into a blog post but I was suffering from some interictal confusion at the time; I will try to return to the post next week (this week?) when I can examine it from a distance and turn the sentences into something coherent. 
- Over on [Cassette Culture](https://reddit.com/r/cassetteculture) there have been many recommendations for using Ikea's [Ladda batteries](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/ladda-rechargeable-battery-hr06-aa-1-2v-00509814/) - I finally picked up a 4-pack of the 1900mAH along with a wall charger. All for less than $15! They're ready to go out of the pack so I'm testing them out right now (Monday) in my walkman. The other two, they're in my Magic Mouse in the basement. 
- I finally got back to building the Deep Space Nine model my friend got me at Christmas (or my birthday? Can't remember). I got the promenade / habitat ring put together, and the three upper pylons. Once I have all the main pieces together I'm going to see about getting some model paint so I can apply the decals later. And then put all the pieces together. 
- Had a work SNAFU over the weekend. Before I explain what happened, I recommend you [read about how my job works](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/radio-traffic/). Anyway, I was covering for one of my coordinators all last week, and she has two very busy radio stations. Turns out on Friday I forgot to transfer the Monday commercial log for one of *my* stations. My producer/sometimes-engineer in Halifax noticed it at 11pm (eastern - so after midnight in Halifax) and sent me a message. Luckily I was awake, and nearby my work laptop as I was messing around on my personal PC (see below in the tech notes). I logged on and transferred the log, but it could have been a lot worse if things didn't go right: that he noticed it was missing, and that I was awake. Crisis averted, but it just goes to show no one is infallible. I mentioned it to my team this morning just to show them that it's OK to make a mistake and that I'm not immune to mistakes.

### Health Notes

- We have another new trainer at the gym. Not yet - but we found out Friday night that our current trainer is leaving for a different gym. He's putting together a list for a suitable replacement for us, but that's two new trainers in the course of a few months. Sucks because we liked this new trainer. 
- I've been neglectful in food logging for a few weeks now. My (scale) weight has gone up consequently and I'm not surprised, but I will get back on track. 

### Tech & Blog Stuff

- Still using the Samsung keyboard. I talked about some of its shortcomings in my post early in the week; since then I discovered that the auto-correct is at times aggressive and other times passive. It's strange trying to figure out when I'll need to manually select the correct word and when I need to tell it to stop correcting a word I re-typed purposefully! (Gboard would let you keep the "misspelling" when you backspace - that's probably a setting in Samsung Keyboard.) Anyway one useful feature is they have a grammar checker built-in, which has been useful in some situations when I knew I made a mistake, but wanted to keep going and fix later. Tap on the green highlight and select the fix, and done! 
  - Another great thing: text shortcuts. It doesn't work exactly the same as text replacement but it's close enough. 
- I decided I'm going to launch a separate photo blog. I looked into some 11ty templates and found one I liked, but I forgot how much work it can be to set up an 11ty blog the way I want it to look. I was working on this site for months before I finally bought the domain name and made it public. I think I'm going to host it somewhere else that has done the work, and then set up a subdomain. More to come. 
- My next tech project is going to be figuring out the Reaper sample rate for audio playback; currently when it plays over Bluetooth the audio is pitched way up and doesn't play properly. The easy solution is to just use 3.5mm audio cable for my speakers, but I'd like to have those hooked up to my Linux box. So, need to address the root issue. 

### Links 

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them.

- [Unexploded WWII bombs buried in Mer Bleue bog, DND confirms | CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/wwii-bombs-mer-bleue-bog-1.6473636)

### Media

- [Mellow My Mind by Brad Sucks](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/bradsucks/mellow-my-mind) (Neil Young cover) 
- I was over at my friend's house, and he has a PS5 - and got the chance to play Hogwarts Legacy. If you haven't heard of it, it's a free-roaming video game sort of like Grand Theft Auto/Red Dead Redemption, where there is a series of quests/story to follow but you can wander around Hogwarts and Hogsmead as freely as you want. It's pretty fun! 
- More video games: I hit 1000 passengers using only 1 tunnel in [Mini Metro](https://dinopoloclub.com/games/mini-metro/). I was trying to unlock the Extreme mode and that was the achievement I needed. Took me a few days over the weekend. 
  - I just learned the developers have another game called [Mini Motorways](https://dinopoloclub.com/games/mini-motorways/) - I'll have to check that one out.
