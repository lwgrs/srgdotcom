### Things I made:

### Personal

- Idly thinking about writing a super basic HTML-only (no CSS) website or individual page - but for what? I don't know. I just like the idea of it. 
- I finished my cassette mixtape! I'm really proud of it. I will be writing something about it later; I have the thoughts to make it into a zine format. There are some pictures in the thread I linked to above.

### Softball &#129358;

- Monday: Loss; 2-for-3 &#10032;
- Wednesday: Win; 1-for-3 &#10032;&#10032;
- &#10032; Another defensive star; I played 3B twice on Monday; the first inning, there was a throw to me for a tag-out - unexpectedly the runner slid and I missed the tag. Later in the game, in another inning, the same runner tried to make a run for third - I got the ball again and this time laid the tag on him easily as he slid into the bag. 
- &#10032;&#10032; Nothing outstanding about this game, just that it was a playoff elimination game and we won! On to the next round for Wednesday. 
- Season stats: GP: 42 | Slug Line[^1]: .625/.647/.875 | 7 Home Runs 

### Healthy Living

- Early Monday morning I woke up in a heavy sweat, head-to-toe. Like, my PJs were drenched, so were the sheets. I don't know why, because our AC was on and set to a comfortable temperature for sleeping. There's 1% of my brain that thinks I might have had a seizure, but I can't be sure. My wife didn't wake up, as she normally would if I had one. I didn't feel any soreness or nausea as I might after a seizure. I'm never conscious when I have one, so there's no other way for me to know. I'm 99% sure I didn't, but that 1% sure holds a lot of weight to it. 
- Weight loss plan is going well. Don't have the numbers in front of me right now but I'm going in the right direction.

### Media

- Watched *[Sully (2016)](https://letterboxd.com/stephen_g/film/sully/)* - pretty good film! Suffers from the usual biopic stuff but it works overall, especially the crash sequences. Good character development through visual means instead of spoken exposition. Did not know this was a Clint Eastwood movie!
