### Things I made:

- [Tuesday Thoughts 04](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/tuesday-04/) 
- [2024 Softball Season Wrap](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/2024-softball/) 
- [Something to get excited about](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/excited/)

- [Forest as captured by an iPod Touch](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/forest-ipod/) 

### Personal

- Unbelievable response to my Tuesday Thoughts post. In particular I heard from **zakb**, [who told me that they admire MY writing](https://mountains.social/@zakb/113355597993137859) and aspires to reach my level. Never thought I'd hear that. 
- My wife and I picked out some new glasses over the weekend. We're happy with our choice, but now we're in that in-between period when we have to wait to get our new pair so it's hard to be excited about them yet. 

### Tech & Blog Stuff

- I decided after all to create an 11ty-based photo blog. I didn't intend to launch it last week, but I did! I was having a ton of fun putting it together piece-by-piece, and created a changelog to track my progress. I ended up launching it on Thursday. Check it out! https://photos.srgower.com 
- For the longest time I was editing files on Github one at a time, pushing one file at a time, wondering how I could edit multiple files before pushing the commit. I found out *by accident* that Github has its own code editor similar to Visual Studio Code. And it does exactly what I want. I feel a little dumb. 

### Media

- Heard ["Lost in Space" by Foster the People](https://fosterthepeople.lnk.to/paradisestateofmind). I liked it - it has the familiar FTP sound, but still different. It's an evolution.
- Finished [A Perfect Likeness](https://www.orcabook.com/A-Perfect-Likeness) by Richard Wagamese. It's a collection of two novellas: *Him Standing* and *The Next Sure Thing*. I thought that *Him Standing* was the better story, and initially made me think the other story was going to be similar in terms of referring to the supernatural. *The Next Sure Thing* wasn't exactly "spooky" but was still enjoyable, it just didn't stick with me the same way as *Him Standing*. What I liked about both is that it's about the protagonist getting trapped in a situation and making efforts to take back control. Nice allegory. Anyway overall I gave this book 3.5/5 stars.
- Cover song: "Are You That Somebody" by The Gossip (original by Aaliyah). Unfortunately can't find a link. I heard it from an Indie Rock Playlist I downloaded in 2006 or 2007. 
- I started season 2 of *The Good Place*. Initially I didn't like the first two episodes of the season, thinking that the show didn't work as well knowing that - **SPOILER ALERT** - they're really in The Bad Place. The character dynamic of Ted Danson's Michael is just completely different when he's evil and talking to the other demons behind the scenes. BUT I soldiered on and I actually like the direction they're headed for season 2.
