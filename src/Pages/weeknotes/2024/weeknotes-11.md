Thanks Melissa :) :) 
- I missed some days in my daily goals (for food logging mostly, but I think one night for brushing my teeth). There are various reasons but the biggest is probably because I got sick (see the healthy living section). 

### Healthy Living

- This past week was a test of my resolve. We took an unplanned trip to my in-laws, where I have little to no control over how food is prepared. Would I be able to keep up with my daily food logging? 
- I got sick Wednesday; probably combination of heat stroke and a homemade sweet dessert not agreeing with me. As I type this (Thursday) I am extremely tired and no amount of napping is helping. 
  - For the last few days I've felt what I would call "abnormally full". In the sense that I stopped eating because I felt absolutely stuffed. This is a new feeling for me - not something that is altogether bad, but something to keep an eye on because it's just not "normal" for me. 

### Media

- I picked *Moon of the Turning Leaves* and *The Star Web* as my next books to read but haven't started them yet. I enjoyed the first book of *The Whitesky Saga* - *Moon of the Crusted Snow* - but I feel like *Turning Leaves* might be a bit of a downer to read and I don't want that kind of read at the moment. I will start it soon, though. 
- Found out about [Paper Apps™ DUNGEON (Physical Notebook)](https://gladdendesign.com/products/paper-apps-dungeon) from [Alexandra's week notes](https://alexandrawolfe.ca/week-notes-june-10-16/) - I'm not sure if I'm going to buy one myself but the concept is really neat. 
- I started yet another "Be a GM" mode for NHL Legacy, using some self-imposed rules. I'm going to write a post about this later in the week. The idea came to mind while I was watching one of the Oilers vs. Panthers Cup Final games.
