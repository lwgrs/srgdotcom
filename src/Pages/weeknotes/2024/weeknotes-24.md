### Things I made:

- [Ottawa Sports Round-Up](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/ottawa-sports/) 
- [On Writing For An Audience](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/writing-audience/) 
- [Friday Thoughts 01](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/friday-thoughts-01/)


### Personal

- My wife and I celebrated our **2 year** wedding anniversary on Tuesday with a simple burger & fries dinner at a local ice cream shop.
- Happy to report my glasses continue to hold together after my Gorilla Glue Repair 
  - However, as soon as we got home Sunday, I found my old glasses. The prescription is close enough so I can get by without having to hope they don't fall apart.
- I wrote a "test" edition of my sports newsletter idea. I like the way it turned out. Undecided if I'll continue with it. 
  - I decided not to go through with it. I don't want to take a fun hobby (following sports) and turn it into work.
- Sunday night I had time to kill, so I fired up my old desktop tower (with [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com) XFCE installed) and play around a bit. I wanted to install a *lighter* weight distro, even though XFCE is already light-weight. I thought this computer couldn't handle Cinnamon. Well, looking "under the hood" I realized that it's more than capable of doing so, so I loaded Cinnamon onto a USB stick and installed it. Currently typing this on said machine right now. 
  - What am I going to do with a desktop PC running Linux? I have no idea. No practical purpose. But it's something to play with, anyway.

### Healthy Living

- My back has been pain-free since last Saturday evening (knock on wood). 

### Links 

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them.

- [A gentle guide to self-hosting your software | ᕕʕ •ᴥ•ʔ୨ Shank Space](https://knhash.in/gentle-guide-to-self-hosting/)  
- [Jagmeet Singh confronts heckling protester on Parliament Hill | CTV News](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/say-it-to-my-face-singh-confronts-heckling-protester-on-parliament-hill-1.7041514) 

### Media

- I finished the *Going Rogue* podcast series - the one specifically about Rogue One. I'm now onto Tansy Gardam's second series of episodes for that podcast, *Going Solo* (which unsurprisingly covers the movie *Solo*).
