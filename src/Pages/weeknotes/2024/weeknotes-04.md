#### Writing this week: 
- [Mini Goals](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/mini-goals/)
- [The Office Drains My Energy](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/office-energy/)
- [All Take and No Give](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/all-take-and-no-give/)
- [NHL 99 (N64) Is An Ugly Game, But It's A Lot of Fun](https://lwgrs.neocities.org/blog/NHL99/nhl99/)
- [Re-Evaluating My Smart Watch Usage](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/smart-watch-usage/)
- A note to my wife 
- Several pages in my journal (current notebook is almost full!)
- Started work on part 2 of The Album Project
- Wrote two introductory paragraphs to epilepsy essay 

#### Personal 
- My wife has been away since Friday and isn't back until this Sunday (the 12th). Like Brandon I have [A Week Alone](https://brandons-journal.com/post/a-week-alone)
- Currently sitting in the office unable to do any work - our main software is down. But overall I find it extremely distracting because the building is more full than usual, and people are getting up and walking back and forth all over the place. Trying to let it go but it's draining my social meter real fast.

#### Healthy Living 
- Went for an x-ray - my first ever, not including dental x-rays. 
    - I went for my foot; I thought I might have a fracture as it's been quite uncomfortable for a few months now. Turns out there is no fracture - just some soft tissue issues
- Trying some new fitness tracking (see above re: smart watch usage). Only on Day 2, but Day 1 was a success, at least.
- Softball started Monday; I went 2-for-3 and hit a home run in my first game!

#### Media 
- Figured out how to scrobble Apple Music listens
- Love Need For Speed Hot Pursuit. The game looks amazing. I really should play it on a big screen TV
