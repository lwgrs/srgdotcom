### Things I made:

- [How About That August?](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/how-about-august/) 
- [Bad Photos, But On Purpose](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/bad-photos/)

### Personal

- Learned about [FreshRSS](https://www.freshrss.org/) via zkbro (see link below) - this seems more up my alley than Feedly; I'll play around with it sometime in the future. 
- This past weekend was super busy. A lot of softball. It's kind of taken over the rest of the week in terms of what I remember happening. Thankfully things are starting to slow down now that we're getting into the Fall.

### Softball &#129358;

- Monday: Loss; 1-for-3 - Double, Run 
- Tuesday: Loss; 2-for-4 - Double, 2 RBI
- Wednesday: Loss; 1-for-3 - SF, Double, 2 RBI 
- I played too many games this weekend to list all the results. And it was COLD, especially Saturday.
- &#10032; Looks like we are OUT for Wednesday playoffs. Takes some pressure off our weekly schedule at least! 
- &#10032;&#10032; I had an unassisted double play on Saturday! I caught a low fly ball at third, and touched the base before the runner got back. 
- 2024 Overall stats: GP: 51 | Slug Line[^1]: .592/.618/.828 | 7 Home Runs *(includes playoffs)*
- Playoff stats: GP: 8 | Slug Line: .444/.500/.611
- I think I'm going to stop reporting weekly softball results and just wrap up the season with an overall stat recap when Fall Ball is done.


### Links 

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them.

### Media

- After [creating a nifty mixtape last week](/weeknotes-21/) I finally listened to it on Monday. I love the way the playlist fit together. The Side B opener "New Love Cassette" is just about a perfect response to Side A's opener "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)" (in terms of audio/the sound aesthetic I was going for). There's a little sun-themed set on Side B (featuring Khalid's "Heatstroke") that is pretty cool as well. I just wish that I had *one more song* because there's a lot of empty time at the end of the track. I haven't flipped the tabs out on the tape yet (in case I needed to re-record anything), so maybe I'll throw an unlisted bonus track on there. Hmmm....
