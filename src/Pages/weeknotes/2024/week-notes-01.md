[Week Notes](https://doingweeknotes.com/?ref=upstract.com) are a popular thing these days. I thought I'd throw my hat in the ring and see how it works for me. The link I provided above looks like it's mainly about productivity but I've seen [examples](https://scribbles.page/mbn9ys1t) of more personal notes, which is what I'm aiming for. 

#### Professional 
- Work has been a mixed bag. *(For context, [read about what I do here](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/radio-traffic/).)* Last week was rather busy because I had a day off on the 5th, and then another day off on the 8th. Even then, the 8th was a bit hectic because I had another employee on my team off and as a team of 4, having two people off is not ideal - so I worked while traveling. 
- But in the latter half of the week things were slow. Thursday was dreadful - I saw two people in the office and no one else. Yesterday was a tad slow as well. I expect things to pick up the rest of this week, though.  
- Slowness can sometimes be helpful to allow me to work ahead so that when things pick up unexpectedly, I have time and space to get more immediate things done. 

#### Personal 
- I've been thinking a lot about writing lately - both about [producing things](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/thoughts-on-writing/) and about being [true to myself in my personal journal](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/vulnerability/). As a result I've spit out several pages' worth of entries in my journal, although not as many written pieces on my blog (or elsewhere). 
- My wife was away for 36 hours (Sunday morning to Monday evening) which allowed me to have some time to myself. I spent it playing a lot of video games[^1]. I also watched some TV, [recorded a podcast](https://jays-from-home.pinecast.co/episode/9ef4ad1b/renovated-home-stand), and did a few other things around the house. 
- My wife is going to be away again Friday to Sunday. I think I'll need to fill my time a little better; perhaps I'll get together with my brother in some capacity - it's his birthday on Saturday. 

#### Healthy Living 
- I don't want to dwell on this too much because I am keeping my "health notes" to myself instead of broadcasting them. 
- My wife and I have a personal trainer at the gym that is helping us with strength training to improve our overall mobility. Looking forward to how that will help us playing softball this summer. 
- Scale weight progress has been all over the place. Trying to be better with my food intake. 
*quick edit*: I forgot to include KT Tape. I am fairly certain I have a fracture of my 5th metatarsal; KT Tape has significantly reduced pain. I should be able to manage it until my doctor appointment at the end of the month.

#### Media 
- As mentioned, watching a lot of TV lately. I've focused on: X-Men (90s cartoon); X-Files; Flight of the Conchords. No movies this past week. 
- I finished reading *Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attentionâ€”and How to Think Deeply Again* by Johann Hari. I have some thoughts about this but haven't put them together either in written form or in podcast form. It was a three-star read for me. 
- Podcasts, podcasts, podcasts. I made my way through a few backlogged items but wanted to highlight one in particular: [Ologies - LIFE ADVICE Encore: For anyone who is tired & needs some hacks](https://www.alieward.com/ologies/lifeadviceencore). I'm not a fan of *all* the advice in this show, but there were some good tips. I try not to get bogged down with "how to be more productive" kind of things but I liked the sentiment behind most of these.

I think that's all I can muster for now. The format here will probably change as I go. Normally I include contact info at the bottom of my posts but for these...I think I'm going to leave them out. 

[^1]: I set up a purposefully *bad* team in NHL Legacy (PS3), so that I can build it up to a powerhouse through the draft and win the cup. I think I made it *too* bad though, my team didn't win a game until November and has a grand total of three points (1 win, 1 tie).
