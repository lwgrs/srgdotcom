#### Personal 
- I had my last few days alone before my wife returned from her work trip. Unfortunately softball was cancelled two of 3 nights, so I had to fill my time with other things (see media notes below). 
- This is sort of a "healthy living" note but not exactly. I'm trying to find ways to get more protein into my diet, and one of the things I'm trying is protein powder. Some things I did this past week: 
    - Figured out the right ratio of protein powder to iced coffee. It's not an exact science yet as the only thing I measure is the protein powder...the rest is eyeballed to the "max fill" line of the blender cup. 
    - Made the strawberry smoothie recipe on the side of the protein powder jar. Added some banana to the mix. Very good. Need to try it with plain greek yogurt instead of vanilla greek yogurt - just a bit too much vanilla. 
- Last week I felt like I worked way more than 5 days during the week (see below). I think I've recovered. 

#### Professional 
- A very tough week at work; our main software went offline for about 2 and a half days. Thank goodness we had a "disaster recovery" plan in place, but that first day we went offline I didn't do very much work because I couldn't work. 
- I worked in the office 4 of 5 days instead of my usual 3, and combined with the software failure - it felt like a really long week.

#### Healthy Living 
- I got a copy of my foot x-ray and exported the scans to JPG. Very cool thing to own. 
    - My foot is getting better. I iced it a little bit last night after softball, but it's not hurting nearly as much. Still trying not to walk as much + wear loose shoes.
- Calorie logging is going well. I'm trying not to focus too much on calories consumed, but more about the act of logging. 
    - Actually, it's not as rosy as I wrote earlier this week. I'm still hitting my goal of logging 1 meal daily though. 

#### Media 
- Reading a little more of *Making It So* (Patrick Stewart's memoir)
- X-Men 90s cartoon; never realized how serialized this show was when I watched as a kid.
- Almost cleared my podcast backlog. It's a good feeling. One episode in particular I enjoyed: [Song Exploder: Peaches - Boys Wanna Be Her](https://pca.st/episode/97f2ead8-81ea-43ab-9339-330b22bed102) 
- Discovered [Open Scrobbler](https://openscrobbler.com/), a website that lets you manually "scrobble" music you're listening to (such as [on cassette[(https://mstdn.ca/@srgower/112416807397683570) 
- Video games - I mostly played NHL Legacy this week. I played some of the most fun games in a long time.
