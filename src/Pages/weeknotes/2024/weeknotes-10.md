### Things I made:
- Forgot to list this last week: [Jays From Home](https://jays-from-home.pinecast.co/)[^1]
- [#Junited2024 continues](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/junited-2024) 
- [Nerdy Blog Stuff](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/nerdy-blog-stuff/)
- [Paywalls, Pain, and Balance](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/paywalls-pain-and-balance/)
- [Stop it, that's my thing!](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/stop-it-thats-my-thing/)
- [New Mastodon Instance](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/new-mastodon-instance/)

### Personal
- I changed Mastodon instances; my new handle is [@srgower@ottawa.place](https://ottawa.place/@srgower). If I did things correctly all my followers & people I follow should transfer over. Only thing that doesn't are posts. I have 2000+ :`( 
- My wife's uncle passed away, so we had some last-minute travel. I expect to be a lot less "online" this week.

### Softball &#129358;
- Monday: Double header. Game 1 (Win): 0-for-2 | Game 2 (Loss): 1-for-2 &#11088;
- Tuesday: Win! 3-for-3 with 1 BB 
- Wednesday: Win! 3-for-4 with 1 RBI &#11088;&#11088;
- Season stats: GP: 14 | Slug Line[^2]: .644/.667/1.644 | 4 Home Runs 
- &#11088; Fun play on Monday - there was a ball hit hard a little to my right and I knew I wasn't going to catch up to it with my glove. I stuck my foot out with the sole (no pun intended) intention of stopping the ball. What happened was I kicked it straight to my rover who picked up the ball and tossed it into the infield. Beautiful play.
- &#11088;&#11088; I had a great defensive game. I alternated between Left Field and Rover with another player and I made a lot of great catches. I was tracking the ball very well. Overall I've had a great week on defense compared to last week. 

### Healthy Living
- We *finally* got back to the gym and personal training. We could have gone on our own without a personal training session, sure, but when we're in softball season it's hard to do it on our own without a schedule forcing us in. 
- I got my bike out for a test ride. I went out for about an hour on Saturday, taking my camera with me for some pictures as well. I need to "develop" them so they will be online somewhere at a later date. 

### Media
- From the [Ruminate](https://ruminatepodcast.com) podcast, episode `186 - A Wallet-Trembling Show`. Robb and John dicuss [the concept of "Our Web" instead of "Small Web"](https://pca.st/episode/f9e175f1-599a-4fae-a603-732e09e9a187?t=1582); it's about 26 minutes in if you're not able to listen via Pocket Casts. 
  - I thought their discussion was great especially the parts where they talk about those who frown upon monetization. 
- Finished reading *Making It So*, Patrick Stewart's memoir. I enjoyed it. I appreciated that the bulk of it covered his life before *Star Trek* because I didn't know very much about his life before that. Plus, a lot of "behind the scenes" stories of *Star Trek* are very well known already, so there wasn't much there he could have written about that would surprise me. I highly recommend it!

### Nerdy Blog Stuff 
- See the "Nerdy Blog Stuff" post I linked to above. Basically I changed up my blog formatting and wrote about it. 
- Updated the layout of `srgower.com`; based it on MGX's McLuhan Lite theme. Links will be in [colophon](/colophon/).
