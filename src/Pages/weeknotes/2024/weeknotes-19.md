### Personal

- Regarding my first post this week I think I'm going to make the edits to my "Now" page to greatly simplify it. I'm not going to continuously update my media consumption - I'll do that on weekly basis using these week notes.
  - I'm also going to reduce the frequency of my website builds in GitHub; I currently have it set to Daily at 6pm, so that it catches all my recent blog posts. But I think I can reduce that to weekly, maybe on Sunday evenings. I don't think people are going to my website to get my latest blog posts (and they can click through to the blog anyway). 
- I found a lead on a replacement Walkman for the one I broke several weeks ago. Won't be able to meet up with the person until next week sometime so I'll have to be patient in the meantime. 
- Had some trouble with srgower.com. As of Tuesday the GitHub > Netlify deploy started failing. It took me most of Wednesday (with help from the [11ty Discord](https://discord.com/channels/741017160297611315/)) to sort out that it was related to the `rss-parser` plugin that I'm using to [display recent blog posts](/blog/). I temporarily disabled it but it was quite annoying to not be able to figure out what was broken. The issue was resolved by Friday and it seemed to be an issue on GitHub's part. 
- Instagram served me an ad for something called [Pocket Dispo](https://pocketdispo.com) - what they call a "disposable lens". They have a lens for several different kinds of camera, including Sony's E-Mount (which is what I use). At $70 it seems hard to pass up. Doing some research into it but it looks like something geared toward taking shots similar to disposable film cameras. 
  - In researching it seems that $70 is quite possibly an inflated price. Found something comparable on Amazon for $45, a lot more palatable. Plus that's in CAD - I think the $70 at pocket dispo is Canadian, but they are shipping internationally. They also seem remarkably easy to DIY but I think I'll purchase one first for now.
- Booked a trip to Calgary a little later this year. That'll be twice this year I'll have travelled to Western Canada, and my first time to Calgary ever.
  

### Softball &#129358;

- Monday: Win; 1-for-3 - 1xBB, 1xR, 2xRBI &#10032;
- Tuesday: Double Header: Game 1: Win; 4-for-4, 2x2B, 5 RBI | Game 2: Loss; 3-for-3, 1xHR, 1 RBI &#10032;&#10032;
- Wednesday: Win; 3-for-3 - 1xR, 2xRBI &#10032;&#10032;&#10032;
- Sunday: Loss; 1-for-3, 1 Run &#10032;&#10032;&#10032;&#10032;
- &#10032; I was having a hard time hitting this pitcher until my last at-bat. Hit a hard ball between the outfielders to left, and scored two runs. It was a single, because the two runs brought us to 6 (the max in an inning), but otherwise would have been a double if we hadn't hit the max. ALSO I made a great catch at third base again on a line drive that was quickly diving down to the ground. If I hadn't caught it, the ball would have hit the ground and bounced to the outfield for sure. 
- &#10032;&#10032; I feel like I'm on a roll at the plate lately. Two nights in a row I've had some very good hard hits, and the home run in this game was certainly unexpected (but very welcome!) 
- &#10032;&#10032;&#10032; This game notable for playing my first inning at 2nd base all year, and probably for the first time in several years. I only had to make one play: a grounder up the middle straight to me, allowing me to just touch the base for the force out. 
- &#10032;&#10032;&#10032;&#10032; None of us had a good game - a lot of pop-ups and weak ground-outs. But I made some great catches in the outfield in the first inning! That was fun. 
- Season stats: GP: 37 | Slug Line[^1]: .648/.669/.904 | 6 Home Runs

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them.

### Media

- Monday night saw a trailer for *[Blink Twice](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/840705-blink-twice)*, a thriller starring Channing Tatum. Having no idea what the movie would be about based on the trailer alone, I looked up the movie. It has what looks like an amazing cast, and is directed by Zoë Kravitz. The description: *"When tech billionaire Slater King meets cocktail waitress Frida at his fundraising gala, he invites her to join him and his friends on a dream vacation on his private island. As strange things start to happen, Frida questions her reality."* I told my wife this sounded interesting to me, and asked if she'd see it, but we quickly determined this is a "me" movie, haha. 
- Another movie that looks interesting: *[Woman of the Hour](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/835113-woman-of-the-hour)*. This is Anna Kendrick's directorial debut and is about the serial killer that appeared on *The Dating Game* in 1978. The poster alone is amazing and one of those rare artistic posters we don't get very much these days. The crazy thing: a friend brought up this story at the bar after softball Monday night, but I don't think she (or anyone) was aware this was being adapted into a movie. 
- One of my favourite shows as a kid, **ReBoot**, is getting a documentary called *ReBoot ReWind*; it'll be released on YouTube on September 24th. Watch the trailer here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ReBoot/comments/1eqrlcf/reboot_rewind_documentary_release_date_special/ 
- Finished reading *[Moon of the Turning Leaves](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/665341/moon-of-the-turning-leaves-by-waubgeshig-rice/9780735281585)* by Waubgeshig Rice. It's an excellent story and weaves traditional Aanishnabe practices with a post-apocalyptic story.

- I'm starting to put together a playlist called "Dreamy Sounds" - I'm starting with "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)" by Nancy Sinatra and "Wicked Game" by Chris Isaak and going from there. The end goal for this playlist is going to be recording it to tape.
