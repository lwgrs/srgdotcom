### Things this week

- I started the week on Monday feeling congested, but my symptoms went away soon after. I think on top of having a cold the time change back to standard time hit me a little harder than most years; for three days straight I was extremely tired. 
- Finally got to start painting my DS9 model; it's going to take a long time, no doubt about that. I started with just the tiny ships (the station model came with the *Defiant* as well as a Cardassian ship), and they are going to take a few coats. The station itself is 16" wide so that's going to take a while...patience is needed. [Here's the most recent progress](https://ottawa.place/@srgower/113464772233593688).
- My [Bluesky post sharing a link to my picture of Bailey](https://bsky.app/profile/srgower.com/post/3laenmtolfu2j) is insanely popular, to date it has 125 likes! They just don't stop. Turns out Bluesky likes dog photos. I had to mute the thread as I was getting so many notifications. 
- Health note: I was thinking about food logging and how I've dropped the ball lately and having a hard time re-building the habit. So I created a public page to keep track of how I'm doing. I get a checkmark if I logged a complete day, an X if I either didn't log at all or logged a partial day. Link to the page is below.
- We got our new glasses! I think I need to go back in to get mine re-adjusted - they keep falling down my nose. I don't know if I'm wearing wrong to begin with or if it's an adjustment that can be made. Originally we didn't change anything when we picked them up. 
- I joined [Writing Month](https://writingmonth.org/), hosted by <a href="https://alpha.polymaths.social/@amin" class="nametag">@Amin</a>. I set my goal to write 30 journal entries in November, specifically to write about something / some moment in detail each day. I'm at 7 to date. I "missed" some days because I hadn't set a goal yet (I joind late!). Most likely I will write about more than one thing on a few upcoming days. I don't know how the buddy system works but you can [view my profile](https://writingmonth.org/~srg84/) and add me as a buddy if you like!

### Tech & Blog Stuff

- I added a logo & favicon to [Photos by Stephen Gower](https://photos.srgower.com/) - and I fixed the social media cards not displaying said logo. I was getting tired of seeing the RSS icon being the preview image. 

### Media

- After a slow start I'm beginning to get into *Something Wicked This Way Comes* by Ray Bradbury. I was trying to finish it before the end of October but the first half of the book is clunky...but still beautifully written. Does that make sense? Anyway, I'm on the last half now, it's drawing my interest a little bit more. 
- I found this fun YouTube channel while trying to find different ways of folding my clothes to maximize space: [Organizing TV - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Organizing-TV). Hosted by Tor (I mistakenly heard him say it as "Thor", which would be pretty cool), he just brings such joy to the simple act of folding clothes.

### Links

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them.
