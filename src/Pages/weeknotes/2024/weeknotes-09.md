### Personal

- I took a vacation day on Monday. I have a LOT of days to use up and no fixed plans to use them. I spent part of it playing video games (played a game of NHL Legacy and MLB The Show 16 respectively), then took care of some other 'round the house things such as putting in our window AC unit in our bedroom. 
- Monday was also World Bicycle Day; I didn't get my bike out though. I wrote a short note about that in the 'healthy living' section. 
- I started re-organizing my OneDrive into a system somewhat resembling [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/); in the process I found a bunch of test HTML files and one of them was an example of an HTML card or box. I thought it was neat. Thinking of incorporating it into my week notes, somehow. An example of what that looks like:

- I mentioned Junited above - I thought I might struggle to find links ahead of time and scramble to put something up each day, but as I type this I have at least 9 chosen and ready to go.

### Softball &#129358;

- Monday: Loss :( 0-for-4.
- Tuesday: Loss :( 4-for-4 with a walk. 2xDoubles, 3 Runs, 1 RBI. 
- Wednesday: Win! :) 2-for-3, 1 RBI
- Season stats: Games Played: 9 | Slug Line[^1]: .647/1.088/.667 | 4 Home Runs 
- In Tuesday's game, I hit a DEEP fly ball to CF; at this point in the game we reached our allotted home runs, which means if I hit one I'd be out. It stopped JUST short of going over the fence and landed sharply at the base. Phew!
- This wasn't a good week for me on defense.

### Healthy Living

- Reached **1 year seizure-free** on June 5th!! ✨ 
- Would love to start biking to work, but waiting on our condo corporation to get some new privacy fences up so I can keep my bike outside.
  - The work finished, and I put my bike shelter up. We were under a heat warning Wednesday, and rain on Thursday, so biking to work is still on hold. 
- I really noticed the difference in playing softball after two weeks off from the gym. I feel beat up and sore all over. 
- Did some light garden work, and pinched/pulled something in my lower back. The rest of Saturday and most of Sunday wasn't too fun. I feel okay today! Hoping to play softball tonight. 

### Media

- I want to figure out some way to put a moratorium on MYSELF and OTHERS from buying new books. 
- I talked myself out of buying a copy of *MVP Baseball 2005* for the GameCube; I had some fun playing a couple of games of *MLB The Show 16* and found some downloadable rosters & suggestions for changing sliders. I fear playing *MVP* might feel like a downgrade. 
- I deleted the [Retro app](/weeknotes-06/). It was a neat idea, but I haven't been returning to it every day and I don't see much point to it. Just another Thing to give my attention to.

### Nerdy Blog Stuff 
- I've thought about moving [my blog](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev) to srgower.com; however I feel like I would need to do a total re-design and re-arrange things and - I don't want to do that. Also re-considering hosting my Week Notes here but I kind of like having them in their own space. 
  - Having said that I *am* considering upgrading my Bear Blog and set the URL to something like `lwgrs.srgower.com` instead of `.bearblog.dev`. 
- I'm thinking of switching Mastodon servers; my current server has suffered from some slow load times and I've heard good things about another one that is more local to me. Still thinking about it.
