### Things I made:

- [Focus](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/focus/) 
- [Affirmation](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/affirmation/)

### Personal

- I picked up [my new Walkman!](https://ottawa.place/@srgower/112995266169951782) It's a Sony WM-FX103, and from the manual I found (direct from Sony's website, in fact) it was manufactured in 1994. So it's 30 years old! At the time of writing this I haven't tested it with a cassette but the radio works great. The only strike against it *so far* is that it isn't an auto-reverse player - but that's not a deal-killer for me. 
- Someone else reached out to me via email after my "Focus" blog post! So nice to hear from people :) 
- This week was a lot lighter in terms of writing / creative output. Just wasn't feeling it. 
- Sunday afternoon we went down for about a 2-hour nap. It was great after a long day in the sun and heat.

  

### Softball &#129358;

- Monday: Win; 3-for-4 - BB, 2B, 2xR 
- Tuesday: Win; 2-for-5 - 1xK, 2xR 
- Wednesday: Loss; 1-for-4, 1xHR, 1xR, 1xRBI, 1xK  &#10032;
- This week saw me get my first strikeout of the season, followed by my second strikeout. I guess I broke the floodgates. 
- &#10032; I hit a massive home run - it went super high and kept flying. It went over the fence and into the beach volleyball court behind the field; measuring on Google Maps I figure it was about 300 feet, at least. 
- Season stats: GP: 40 | Slug Line[^1]: .630/.653/.891 | 7 Home Runs 

### Healthy Living

- I forgot to mention this last week; LAST weekend (August 17-18) I took a break from food logging. While I'm trying to stay consistent with logging every day, every once in a while I just need a break and this is a healthy thing to do. It's easy to get lost in daily logging and become obsessed with it. 
  - And this weekend I took an unintentional break on Sunday (yesterday). It was a busy day (my wife and I marched in the city's pride parade) and there would have been a lot of estimating involved and I didn't have the mental capacity to deal with that.

### Links 

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them. 

- [How accurate are wearable fitness trackers? Less than you might think | Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/how-accurate-are-wearable-fitness-trackers-less-than-you-might-think/)

### Media

- A little review of the Walkman I mentioned; I listened to two tapes: Harry Chapin's Short Stories, and Billy Idol's 1984 self-titled album. I used the "Mega Bass" function for the Chapin album, because the bass was not very pronounced. But when I put on the Billy Idol tape, and left Mega Bass on, it seemed to boost up all of the other levels, so the treble channels were way too high. It created some harsh sounds and some sibilance at the high ends. I turned it off and the bass notes still sounded good, so I guess it depends on the mix of the music whether it's beneficial or not. 

### Nerdy Blog Stuff 
- You may or may not have noticed I've started including "week notes" images - I generated them with Google Gemini and I made different versions. Just seeing if I like it or not. I recognize using AI tools to generate images is controversial - you can [read my thoughts about it here](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/googles-gemini-isnot-that-bad/).
