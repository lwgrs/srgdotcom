### Things this week

-  I made progress with my Deep Space Nine model! I ran out of dark gray paint on the weekend, so painting the station had to take a back seat. I decided to tackle the decals for the small ships: The Defiant, and the Cardassian warship. Holy moly...the decals are as tedious as I imagined. And at the same time, they're also not as complicated as I thought. I'm still terrible at decals. 
- [Writing month](https://writingmonth.org) is going well. I'm very happy with my journal entries! I was a little light on blog entries but wrote a LOT in my journal. 
- I think I should start getting into voice to text, at least when I'm out walking my dog and I want to type things. I'm very self-conscious about doing it though, it feels weird to say `That sounds good period` to type `That sounds good.`.
- I'm always looking for optimizing my shoelaces. I have a pair of shoes (that are overdue for replacing) with laces that are too long when I tie them. Either the loops or the lace ends are perilously close to landing under my feet as I walk. So I did some searching around and found some options to shorten the laces without cutting them. I'm satisfied with the results so far. 
- It was a tough week at work. Cuts, selling off stations...it's these weeks that affect me mentally more than I initially realize. It's a reality of the industry I work in but it doesn't make it any easier.

### Health Notes 

- I made it to the gym Friday morning! I intended to go Thursday morning, but missed my alarm. And then I intended to go Thursday evening, but the day was such a mess that I didn't want to go. But I got out after 6am on Friday and did 20 minutes on a bike, and 5 minutes of rowing. 

### Things I made this week

- [Folding & Organizing Clothes | An Almost Anonymous Blog](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/organizing/) 
- [Mastodon vs. Bluesky: It's not the battle you might think it is | An Almost Anonymous Blog](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/mastodon-vs-bluesky/) 
- [Audio Weeknotes | An Almost Anonymous Blog](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/audio-weeknotes/) 
  - [2024 - Week 47](https://weeknotes.pinecast.co/episode/c94a9302/2024-week-47)

### Tech & Blog Stuff

- I changed the URL structure again. I had the thought when I was looking up last week's post to find something. It's now, going forward, `/weeknotes/YYYY-week-##/`. It makes more sense in context. Consider, `https://srgower.com/2024/weeknotes-32/` vs. `https://srgower.com/weeknotes/2024-week-33/`. 
- <a href="https://mgx.me/" class="nametag">MGX</a> released a new CSS theme for Bear Blog, ["abzug" theme for bear blog](https://mgx.me/abzug-theme-for-bear-blog). I really like it, so I made some modifications to include some add-ons I've tailored for my blog over the past little while and set it up for my blog. You can see it at https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev. 
- I added basic analytics to the photo blog, courtesy of [Tinylytics](https://tinylytics.app). I don't think I'll be adding it to this site though.

### Media

- Finished *Only Murders in the Building* season 4. It was a great season! Very well-constructed. I don't want to talk too much about it lest I spoil anything for anybody. This is my second favourite season, after the first. My order of preference: 1 \> 4 \> 3 \> 2 
- Foster the People - *Paradise State of Mind* - Their newest album. [A few weeks back](/weeknotes-29/) I wrote about their song "Lost in Space". The rest of the album is pretty good! Highly recommend it. 

### Links

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them.

-  [Animated Knots by Grog | Learn how to tie knots with step-by-step animation](https://www.animatedknots.com/) - I like sites that offer this kind of instruction.
