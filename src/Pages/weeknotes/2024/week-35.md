### Things this week

-  PWHL Ottawa Charge vs. Montreal Victoire - Canadian Tire Centre. The atmosphere was great, very family-friendly with a lot of kids. Especially young girls holding signs about how they want to be professional hockey players. Arena music was way too loud, though.  
- Snow shovel count is now up to **2**. We had two major snow falls this week. 
- Am I the only one who gets mildly annoyed when people are walking on the *right* side of the road as opposed to the *left* side of the road? You should be walking toward oncoming traffic so you can see each other!

### Media

- Trying Apple Music for a month (free trial). So far, there are aspects I both like and dislike. I haven't tried it enough to form a proper opinion. Of course I will before the free trial ends. The next Spotify payment and the end of the free trial coincide so that makes it handy for decision time. 
  - So far, I prefer Spotify's personalized playlists but I think part of that is because they have so much data on my listening habits compared to Apple. 
  - Audio quality on Apple Music is much better than Spotify! 
- Finished Brent Spiner's *Fan Fiction*. This will be the last book I'm logging for at least a year. 
  - Started re-reading *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, and started *Swing Kings* (baseball, non-fiction)
