### Things I made:

- [Hodgepodge](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/hodgepodge/)
- [I still don't have my tape deck](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/i-still-dont-have-my-tape-deck/)
- [Review: Sleeman Zero +](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/sleeman-zero/)
- [Junified 2024](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/junified-2024/) *This wasn't my idea - inspired by [Robert Birming](https://birming.com/junited-how-who/)*

### Personal

- We're short a moderator on [/r/podcasts](https://reddit.com/r/podcasts/). I forgot how much heavy lifting there is. We're trying to automate some more things but also (slowly) starting the recruitment process for an extra moderator. 
- Another reason for ditching Notion for my `.md` templates: when I had links that went to subdirectories (like `/weeknotes/`) it inserted `https://notion.so/` in front of it...why??? 
- Two pay periods in a row we were charged more than expected by our gym...trying to sort this out. We're enjoying our experience there, but it's frustrating when you budget for a specific amount and double the amount budgeted comes out of your account. 
- Got out to two local baseball teams this weekend! The [Ottawa Titans](https://www.ottawatitans.com/) hosted the [Windy City Thunderballs](https://www.wcthunderbolts.com/); the home team (Titans) won both games, winning the second one by a score of 17-5. That game was wild. 

### Softball

- Monday: *rain-out* 
- Tuesday: Win! 2-for-4 (Home Run, BB)
- Wednesday: Win! 2-for-2 (Walk, RBI, Run)
- Season stats: .571/.588/1.214 (AVG/OBP/SLG) / 1.803 OPS | 1 K, 2 BB, 1 2B, 4 HR, 16 RBI

### Healthy Living

- My weight is going back down, hovering in the ~259-260 range. I anticipate some more positive changes next month when my micro goal is to log all my meals daily, instead of 1 minimum meal logged daily.
- I tried wearing my smart watch while playing softball on Wednesday. What holds me back is that it doesn't sit well on my wrist when I wear batting gloves. It worked out okay; I loosened the strap a ton and got the batting glove to fit without the two accessories getting in each others' way. 
- I switched my pill times from 8:45 am/pm to 9 am/pm. Mostly so I can sleep in longer on weekends.
- Starting June 1st, my new goal for food logging is ALL meals Monday-Friday, and at least 1 meal on weekends

### Media

- I've been enjoying Spotify "Daylists" - the music is not always what I want to hear, but the titles are often times bizarre. I'm tracking them in a [Notion](https://notion.so) database. 
- My brother sent me this podcast a few weeks back and I finally started listening. As an avid curler and curling watcher, I knew mostly about this story but not as many of the details as I thought. A good listen. [Broomgate: A Curling Scandal](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/1427-broomgate-a-curling-scandal)
- My wife and I finished both **Star Trek Discovery** and **The Crown**.
  - The *Discovery* was okay; it's tough when my comparison for a season finale came just last weekend when I watched *Star Trek: The Next Generation*'s *All Good Things*. This entire season was one long treasure hunt and while there were fun moments, I miss the more contemplative *Star Trek*. I guess that's what we have *Strange New Worlds* for. 
  - *The Crown*'s last season started off strong, but I felt that the last 6 episodes were uneven. The finale was definitely strange with Imaulda Staunton's Queen Elizabeth getting visited by previous versions of herself (played by Olivia Colman and Claire Foy) throughout the episode. It was a bit weird and definitely A Choice. Still, it was better than the last two seasons. 
- I played some more of *Need For Speed Hot Pursuit* (PS3) on the weekend. I still think it's a great game but I haven't fully grasped controlling the car. For example, there are a few race courses you need to beat the clock to catch a suspect but the car you're given can drive 200+ km/h. It's super hard to control a car at that speed in the game! But realistic, I suppose. One thing I wish existed: that in the "police free drive" (where you can drive around the road courses without affecting "career" stats) you are able to chase down suspects.
