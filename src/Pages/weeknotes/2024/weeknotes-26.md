### Things I made:

### Personal

- This has been a strange week for me. Monday and Tuesday were spent travelling, and then I had a very busy work day coming back from being off a day. That's usually busy, but Wednesday-Thursday-Friday were all exceptionally busy. I did some extra work Thursday night after a Fall Feast just to catch up. As a result my mind hasn't been in a super creative state. That's fine, there are always ups and downs. 
- I returned to "No Socials Sunday" this week - the past few weeks I've been bypassing the lock-out on my phone 
- I got new shoes on the weekend! Basic Sketchers slip-ons that are similar to a pair I found second-hand, but they're a good stop-gap until I buy a proper pair of walking shoes.

### Healthy Living

- I have a slight cold. It started with a scratchy throat Wednesday afternoon and by Thursday overnight I had a killer sore throat in the middle of the night. I sound and feel better as I write this (Saturday) but am still hoping no more symptoms develop. I hate having to tackle the different symptoms of a cold separately but that's usually how my body works (sore throat & cough &#12299; congestion &#12299; stubborn symptoms that won't go away). 

### Techn & Blog Stuff

- I'm trying out Mozilla Thunderbird (beta) on my phone. I've never been satisfied with an email client other than Gmail since Inbox bit the dust, so I'm curious to see how this performs. So far, so good. 
- Also trying to fix Gboard on my phone. I find I suffer from fat fingers way too much and it bothers me to no end. Sure there's autocorrect but I make too many errors for my liking in the first place. What I've tried so far is removing the number row so that the letters have more space. Seems to be working. 
- Did some work on the [contrasts site](https://contrasts.srgower.com): finished adding all the colour combos I've saved to date, and I think I have the mobile view working properly now. Or at least all the table entries fit on a mobile screen and are in the proper order.


### Links 

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them.

- [The Subtle Art of Always Quitting Your Hobbies | Yordi](https://yordi.me/the-subtle-art-of-always-quitting-your-hobbies/) &#x27EA; I identify with \*gestures\* all of this. Found this link from [Robert Birming](https://birming.com) 
- [Pluralistic: Sandra Newman’s “Julia” (28 Sep 2024) – Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/28/novel-writing-machines/) &#10218; a book to check out 
- [New book explores the art and activism of pioneering Indigenous artist Carl Beam | CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/art-indigenous-pioneer-truth-reconciliaton-contemporary-1.7334135) 
- [Setting up systems – space • time • tech](https://spacetimetech.wordpress.com/2024/09/30/setting-up-systems/) 
- [The Sticker Book • Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/blog/the-sticker-book/) &#10218;- I should get a sticker book too. I have the same problem.

### Media

- I started reading *[Stories Of Your Life and Others](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c34ac03b-3b0e-4a24-b694-e46674918a3a)* by Ted Chiang. The title story is what *Arrival* was based on. Thought I'd read this story first and flip through the other stories.
