### Things this week

- I forgot to mention that last week someone reached out to me about my [Dreamy Sounds mixtape](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/dreamy-sounds-mixtape/). So awesome to read feedback from people reading my stuff. 
- I took a new profile photo! I'm slowly populating it around my online presences, starting here. It's on the <a href="/">home page</a>. 
- My wife and I decided last minute to go to an Ottawa Senators game. They lost in overtime, but it was a fun game. A bit of a splurge but worth it. 
- For the third year in a row our softball team went axe throwing! We do a tournament and I made it to the finals (I made it to the finals in the first year too). But I lost...I was millimetres from forcing a third game for the best 2 out of 3 but just missed. 
  - I had a really tasty mocktail - it was lemonade, ginger beer (made by a local brewery), cinnamon, and brown sugar. I kind of want to look up mocktails I can make at home as an alternative to just non-alcoholic beer.
- Still working on optimal methods for folding clothes. I think I'm going to write a post about it. 
- [Writing Month](https://writingmonth.org) is still going well. I'm up to 15 / 30 for my writing goal (of one journal entry a day). 

### Health Notes 

- My logging streak to date: 
- Somehow I missed that I passed 5 years since my first seizure (Nov 9 2019). On a related note, I discovered this thread on reddit and I spent some time reading over it. https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1grfz2a/simple_question_what_do_you_dislike_the_most/ 
- Got our COVID & flu shots; this year I didn't get as much pain in the arm as in previous years. Other than a nice long nap Saturday afternoon I didn't really feel any side effects. 

### Things I made this week

- [More 11ty Stuff | An Almost Anonymous Blog](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/more-11ty-stuff/) 
- [Bate Island | Photos by Stephen Gower](https://photos.srgower.com/2024/bate-island/)

### Tech & Blog Stuff

- As we're getting close to the end of 2024 I realized that I was shortsighted in assigning URLs to these weeknotes. I corrected the URL to now be `/YYYY/weeknotes-##/` - for example, today's link is `/2024/weeknotes-32/`. I set the permalink to previous notes to their original URL so that old links aren't broken. But now I will be able to start over at `01` for 2025. Yes, this probably only matters to me.
  - I learned about this permalink method while putting together the photo blog. File under "things I wish I paid more attention to earlier". 
- At the behest of my friend I added an email subscription link to my photo blog. It seems to work well, and displays the whole post in the email on my two tests. It's not *my* preferred method of post delivery, but the option is there for people who want it.
- An interesting use of Bear Blog! Learned some new things here: [Displaying a feed of short-form content | sylvia.bearblog.dev](https://sylvia.bearblog.dev/short-form-content/) (found via <a href="https://social.lol/@birming" class="nametag">Robert</a>'s post: [Bear Micro Blog | Robert Birming](https://birming.com/bear-micro-blog/))

### Media

- Speaking of my Dreamy Sounds mixtape earlier...I have a starting point for another mixtape. One song. And I hope to put something together based solely on my physical media collection. But I don't know where I'm going with it yet. 
- Finally watched the first episodes of the latest seasons of Lower Decks (the final season :() and Only Murders in the Building. I only intended on watching one episode of OMITB but the first episode was absolutely thrilling, I hopped on to episode 2. Looking forward to the rest of the season. 
- I also finished season 2 of The Good Place. I wasn't as much of a fan of season 2, but I like where it ended up. So far I find the conceit of wiping the character's memories at the end of each season intriguing. Not sure if that's continuing but it's a good way to set up a different plot thread for the next season while keeping it fresh. In hindsight the show could only go so far with the plot of the first season so it makes sense that they would change it up.  
- I re-watched *Casino Royale*; holy moly there is so much product placement for Sony in that movie. Almost all of the tech is Sony. Apparently, at the time, MGM was owned by Sony so I guess this makes sense. 
- I saw this post from <a href="https://dhester.blog" class="nametag">Darren Hester</a>: [Creating Art From Sticker Spotter Posts](https://dhester.blog/post/creating-art-from-sticker-spotter-posts) Anyway he has a link in that post to an iPad app called Linea Sketch. I checked it out, and it's really neat. Never mind the fact that I'm not a drawer, I just like playing with these things. Also, great artwork as always, Darren!

### Links

Just some things I've read online that interested me and I didn't get around to writing about them.

-  <a href="https://veronique.ink" class="nametag">Véronique</a> has a new zine out: [Monstrous Existence 3](https://buymeacoffee.com/veronique/e/329887). Limited to 30 copies! Hopefully by the time this is published, she'll have sold out. I bought one! 
- [Understanding Banal Photography | Andy Hawthorne Photography](https://andyhawthorne.co.uk/understanding-banal-photography/) 
- [Rust Red River](https://rustredriver.com/blog/20241025-cyberia-moving-to-linux.html) - I think I found this while reading through <a href="https://html-chunder.neocities.org/" class="nametag">zak</a>'s Mastodon [post about diving into Linux](https://html-chunder.neocities.org/quick-post/202411121816/). Digging through the Mastodon replies I saw that Rust Red River blog post and mention of the *Ultramarine* distro and after taking a look at [their webiste](https://ultramarine-linux.org/) I kind of want to try it out, at least on a live USB. I have no issues with Linux Mint, but it's also fun to play around with different systems.
