*Week of May 14-20, 2024*

[&#8617; Back to list](/weeknotes/) 

#### Things I made: 
- [Returning defective products is harder than it should be](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/defective-keurig/)

#### Personal 
- Two home runs in one game! One was a grand slam!
- I wasn't as prolific with creating things (for the public) as last week. I wouldn't say I'm *burnt out* but feel like I used a lot of creative juice that needs replenishing 
- I had some leftover quotes from [Outsider](TK) that I cut and pasted into my [current journal](TK) 
- Got out of the city for the long weekend. Always good for recharging the batteries. 
- have been using the [Retro app](https://retro.app/) as suggested by [JCProbably](https://notes.jeddacp.com/post/a-photo-a-day-with-the-retro-app). I haven't added any friends/contacts, but is neat for uploading daily pictures.

#### Healthy Living 
- Spent the weekend outside of the city and (mostly) offline
- Also spent the weekend NOT wearing my smartwatch. I survived!
- Mosquitos and sand flies are vile creatures

#### Media 
- Read more of *Making It So* (Patrick Stewart)
