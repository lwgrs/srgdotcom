Hi, my name is Stephen Gower. I am a writer and podcaster. I'm a fan of books, podcasts, hockey, baseball, curling & movies. I currently work as the Regional Traffic Manager for Rogers Radio in Ottawa. I was also diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 35. Sometimes I talk about that.

If you'd like to get in touch with me, I have a few options for you:
